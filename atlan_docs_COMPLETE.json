To create a user with a key-pair, replace the value for `rsa_public_key` with the public key and run the following:\n\n```codeBlockLines_e6Vv\nCREATE USER atlan_user rsa_public_key='MIIBIjANBgkqh...' default_role=atlan_user_role default_warehouse='<warehouse-name>' display_name='Atlan'\nTYPE = 'SERVICE'\n\n```\n\n- Learn more about the `SERVICE` type property in [Snowflake documentation](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/create-user#optional-object-properties-objectproperties).\n\n**Did you know?**\n\nAtlan only supports encrypted private keys with a non-empty passphrase - generally recommended as more secure. An empty passphrase results in workflow failures. To generate an encrypted private key, omit the `-nocrypt` option. Refer to [Snowflake documentation](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/key-pair-auth) to learn more.\n\n#### With a password in Snowflake [‚Äã](https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/data-warehouses/snowflake/how-tos/set-up-snowflake\\#with-a-password-in-snowflake \"Direct link to With a password in Snowflake\")\n\n**Did you know?**\n\nSnowflake recommends transitioning away from basic authentication using username and password. Change to key-pair authentication for enhanced security. For any existing Snowflake workflows, you can [modify the crawler configuration](https://docs.atlan.com/product/connections/how-tos/manage-connectivity) to update the authentication method.\n\nTo create a user with a password, replace `<password>` and run the following:\n\n```codeBlockLines_e6Vv\nCREATE USER atlan_user password='<password>' default_role=atlan_user_role default_warehouse='<warehouse-name>' display_name='Atlan'\nTYPE = 'LEGACY_SERVICE'\n\n```\n\n- Learn more about the `LEGACY_SERVICE` type property in [Snowflake documentation](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/create-user#optional-object-properties-objectproperties).\n\n#### Managed through your identity provider (IdP) Private preview [‚Äã](https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/data-warehouses/snowflake/how-tos/set-up-snowflake\\#managed-through-your-identity-provider-idp- \"Direct link to managed-through-your-identity-provider-idp-\")\n\nThis method is currently only available if Okta is your IdP (Snowflake supports) [authenticating natively through Okta](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/admin-security-fed-auth-use#native-sso-okta-only):\n\n- Create a user in your identity provider (IdP) and [use federated authentication in Snowflake](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/admin-security-fed-auth-use.html#managing-snowflake-user-passwords).\n- The password for this user must be maintained solely in the IdP and multi-factor authentication (MFA) must be disabled.\n\n### Grant role to user [‚Äã](https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/data-warehouses/snowflake/how-tos/set-up-snowflake\\#grant-role-to-user \"Direct link to Grant role to user\")\n\nTo grant the `atlan_user_role` to the new user:\n\n```codeBlockLines_e6Vv\nGRANT ROLE atlan_user_role TO USER atlan_user;\n\n```\n\n### Configure OAuth (client credentials flow) with Microsoft Entra ID [‚Äã](https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/data-warehouses/snowflake/how-tos/set-up-snowflake\\#configure-oauth-client-credentials-flow-with-microsoft-entra-id \"Direct link to Configure OAuth (client credentials flow) with Microsoft Entra ID\")\n\nTo configure OAuth authentication using Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure AD) with the client credentials flow:\n\n1. Follow [Snowflake's documentation](https://community.snowflake.com/s/article/Create-External-OAuth-Token-Using-Azure-AD-For-The-OAuth-Client-Itself) to:\n   - Register a new application in Microsoft Entra ID\n   - Collect the `client ID`, `tenant ID`, and `client secret`\n   - Add the required API permissions\n2. In Snowflake, create a security integration using the following:\n\n\n\n\n\n```codeBlockLines_e6Vv\nCREATE SECURITY INTEGRATION external_oauth_azure_ad\n       TYPE = external_oauth\n       ENABLED = true\n       EXTERNAL_OAUTH_TYPE = azure\n       EXTERNAL_OAUTH_ISSUER = '\\<AZURE_AD_ISSUER\\>'\n       EXTERNAL_OAUTH_JWS_KEYS_URL = '\\<AZURE_AD_JWS_KEY_ENDPOINT\\>'\n       EXTERNAL_OAUTH_AUDIENCE_LIST = ('\\<SNOWFLAKE_APPLICATION_ID_URI\\>')\n       EXTERNAL_OAUTH_TOKEN_USER_MAPPING_CLAIM = 'sub'\n       EXTERNAL_OAUTH_SNOWFLAKE_USER_MAPPING_ATTRIBUTE = 'login_name';\n\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   - Replace the placeholders with actual values from your Azure AD app:\n   - `<AZURE_AD_ISSUER>` ‚Üí Your tenant's OAuth 2.0 issuer URL\n   - `<AZURE_AD_JWS_KEY_ENDPOINT>` ‚Üí Azure JWKs URI\n   - `<SNOWFLAKE_APPLICATION_ID_URI>` ‚Üí Application ID URI of the Azure app\n3. Create a Snowflake user with a login name that exactly matches the Azure AD client object ID:\n\n\n\n\n\n```codeBlockLines_e6Vv\nCREATE USER oauth_svc_user\n       WITH LOGIN_NAME = '\\<AZURE_AD_CLIENT_OBJECT_ID\\>'  -- Use Azure client OBJECT ID\n       DEFAULT_ROLE = \\<ROLE\\>\n       DEFAULT_WAREHOUSE = \\<WAREHOUSE\\>;\n\n```\n\n4. Grant the configured role to this user:\n\n\n\n\n\n```codeBlockLines_e6Vv\nGRANT ROLE \\<ROLE\\> TO USER oauth_svc_user;\n\n```\n\n\n## Choose metadata fetching method [‚Äã](https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/data-warehouses/snowflake/how-tos/set-up-snowflake\\#choose-metadata-fetching-method \"Direct link to Choose metadata fetching method\")\n\nAtlan supports two methods for fetching metadata from Snowflake - account usage and information schema. You should choose one of these two methods to set up Snowflake:\n\n|  | Account usage | Information schema |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| **Overview** | Simplified grants but some limitations in functionality | Most comprehensive approach, more grant management required |\n| **Method** | Views in the `SNOWFLAKE` database that display object metadata and usage metrics for your account | System-defined views and table functions that provide extensive metadata for objects created in your account |\n| **Permissions** | User role and account, single grant for `SNOWFLAKE` database | User role and account, multiple grants per database |\n| **Data latency** | 45 minutes to 3 hours (varies by view) | None |\n| **Historical data retention** | 1 year | 7 days to 6 months (varies by view or table function) |\n| **Asset extraction** | `ACCOUNT_USAGE` schema | `INFORMATION_SCHEMA` schema |\n| **View lineage** | `ACCOUNT_USAGE` schema | `INFORMATION_SCHEMA` schema |\n| **Table lineage** | `ACCOUNT_USAGE` schema | `ACCOUNT_USAGE` schema |\n| **Tag import** | `ACCOUNT_USAGE` schema | `ACCOUNT_USAGE` schema |\n| **Usage and popularity** | `ACCOUNT_USAGE` schema | `ACCOUNT_USAGE` schema |\n| **Metadata extraction time** | Varies by warehouse size. For example, 8 minutes for 10 million assets (recommended for extracting a large number of assets) | Varies by warehouse size. For example, 2+ hours for 10 million assets |\n| **Extraction limitations** | External table location data, procedures, and primary and foreign keys | None |\n\n## Grant permissions for account usage method [‚Äã](https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/data-warehouses/snowflake/how-tos/set-up-snowflake\\#grant-permissions-for-account-usage-method \"Direct link to Grant permissions for account usage method\")\n\ndanger\n\nIf you want to set warehouse timeouts when using this method, set a large value initially for the workflow to succeed. Once the workflow has succeeded, adjust the value to be twice the extraction time.\n\nThis method uses the views in `SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE` (or a copied version of this schema) to fetch the metadata from Snowflake into Atlan. You can be more granular with permissions using this method, but there are [limitations with this approach](https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/data-warehouses/snowflake/troubleshooting/troubleshooting-snowflake-connectivity).\n\n### To crawl assets, generate lineage, and import tags [‚Äã](https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/data-warehouses/snowflake/how-tos/set-up-snowflake\\#to-crawl-assets-generate-lineage-and-import-tags \"Direct link to To crawl assets, generate lineage, and import tags\")\n\nIf you also want to be able to preview and query the data, you can use the preview and query existing assets permissions instead.\n\nSnowflake [stores all tag objects](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/object-tagging#discover-tags) in the `ACCOUNT_USAGE` schema. If you're using the [account usage method](https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/data-warehouses/snowflake/how-tos/set-up-snowflake#grant-permissions-for-account-usage-method) to crawl metadata in Atlan or you have [configured the Snowflake miner](https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/data-warehouses/snowflake/how-tos/mine-snowflake), you need to grant the same permissions to [import tags](https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/data-warehouses/snowflake/how-tos/manage-snowflake-tags) as required for crawling Snowflake assets. Note that object tagging in Snowflake currently requires [Enterprise Edition or higher](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/intro-editions#feature-edition-matrix).\n\n- To use the default `SNOWFLAKE` database and `ACCOUNT_USAGE` schema and also mine Snowflake's query history (for lineage), grant these permissions:\n\n```codeBlockLines_e6Vv\nUSE ROLE ACCOUNTADMIN;\nGRANT IMPORTED PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE SNOWFLAKE TO ROLE atlan_user_role;\n\n```\n\n- The `ACCOUNTADMIN` role is required to grant privileges on the `SNOWFLAKE` database due to the following reasons:\n  - By default, only the `ACCOUNTADMIN` role can access the `SNOWFLAKE` database.\n  - To enable other roles to access the database and schemas and query the views, a user with the `ACCOUNTADMIN` role needs to grant `IMPORTED PRIVILEGES` on the `SNOWFLAKE` database to the desired roles.\n- To use a copied or cloned version of this default schema, where you can also remove any sensitive data for security purposes, grant these permissions:\n\n\n```codeBlockLines_e6Vv\nGRANT USAGE ON DATABASE \"<copied-database>\" TO ROLE atlan_user_role;\nGRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA \"<copied-schema>\" IN DATABASE \"<copied-database>\" TO ROLE atlan_user_role;\nGRANT REFERENCES ON ALL VIEWS IN DATABASE \"<copied-database>\" TO ROLE atlan_user_role;\n\n```\n\n- Replace `<copied-database>` with the copied Snowflake database name.\n- Replace `<copied-schema>` with the copied Snowflake `ACCOUNT_USAGE` schema name.\n- The grants for the copied version can't be used on the original `SNOWFLAKE` database. This is because Snowflake produces an error that granular grants can't be given to imported databases.\n- When using a cloned or copied version, verify that the table or view definition remains unchanged as in your `SNOWFLAKE` database. If the format is different. For example, a column is missing and it no longer qualifies as a clone.\n\n### To crawl streams [‚Äã](https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/data-warehouses/snowflake/how-tos/set-up-snowflake\\#to-crawl-streams \"Direct link to To crawl streams\")\n\nTo crawl streams, provide the following permissions:\n\n- **To crawl current streams:**\n\n```codeBlockLines_e6Vv\nGRANT USAGE ON ALL SCHEMAS IN DATABASE \"<database-name>\" TO ROLE atlan_user_role;\nGRANT REFERENCES ON ALL TABLES IN DATABASE \"<database-name>\" TO ROLE atlan_user_role;\nGRANT SELECT ON ALL STREAMS IN DATABASE \"<database-name>\" TO ROLE atlan_user_role;\n\n```\n\n- Replace `<database-name>` with the Snowflake database name.\n\n- **To crawl future streams:**\n\n\n```codeBlockLines_e6Vv\nGRANT USAGE ON FUTURE SCHEMAS IN DATABASE \"<database-name>\" TO ROLE atlan_user_role;\nGRANT REFERENCES ON FUTURE TABLES IN DATABASE \"<database-name>\" TO ROLE atlan_user_role;\nGRANT SELECT ON FUTURE STREAMS IN DATABASE \"<database-name>\" TO ROLE atlan_user_role;\n\n```\n\n- Replace `<database-name>` with the Snowflake database name.\n\n### (Optional) To preview and query existing assets [‚Äã](https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/data-warehouses/snowflake/how-tos/set-up-snowflake\\#optional-to-preview-and-query-existing-assets \"Direct link to (Optional) To preview and query existing assets\")\n\nTo query and preview data within assets that already exist in Snowflake, add these permissions:\n\n```codeBlockLines_e6Vv\nGRANT USAGE ON DATABASE \"<database-name>\" TO ROLE atlan_user_role;\nGRANT USAGE ON ALL SCHEMAS IN DATABASE \"<database-name>\" TO ROLE atlan_user_role;\nGRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN DATABASE \"<database-name>\" TO ROLE atlan_user_role;\nGRANT SELECT ON ALL EXTERNAL TABLES IN DATABASE \"<database-name>\" TO ROLE atlan_user_role;\nGRANT SELECT ON ALL VIEWS IN DATABASE \"<database-name>\" TO ROLE atlan_user_role;\nGRANT SELECT ON ALL MATERIALIZED VIEWS IN DATABASE \"<database-name>\" TO ROLE atlan_user_role;\nGRANT SELECT ON ALL STREAMS IN DATABASE \"<database-name>\" TO ROLE atlan_user_role;\nGRANT MONITOR ON PIPE \"<pipe-name>\" TO ROLE atlan_user_role;\n\n```\n\nReplace `<database-name>` with the database you want to be able to preview and query in Atlan. (Repeat the statements for every database you wish to preview and query in Atlan.)\n\n### (Optional) To preview and query future assets [‚Äã](https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/data-warehouses/snowflake/how-tos/set-up-snowflake\\#optional-to-preview-and-query-future-assets \"Direct link to (Optional) To preview and query future assets\")\n\nTo query and preview data within assets that may be created in the future in Snowflake, add these permissions. Again, if you want to also be able to preview and query the data for future assets, you can add the preview and query future assets permissions instead.\n\n```codeBlockLines_e6Vv\nGRANT USAGE ON FUTURE SCHEMAS IN DATABASE \"<database-name>\" TO ROLE atlan_user_role;\nGRANT SELECT ON FUTURE TABLES IN DATABASE \"<database-name>\" TO ROLE atlan_user_role;\nGRANT SELECT ON FUTURE EXTERNAL TABLES IN DATABASE \"<database-name>\" TO ROLE atlan_user_role;\nGRANT SELECT ON FUTURE VIEWS IN DATABASE \"<database-name>\" TO ROLE atlan_user_role;\nGRANT SELECT ON FUTURE MATERIALIZED VIEWS IN DATABASE \"<database-name>\" TO ROLE atlan_user_role;\nGRANT SELECT ON FUTURE STREAMS IN DATABASE \"<database-name>\" TO ROLE atlan_user_role;\nGRANT MONITOR ON FUTURE PIPES IN DATABASE \"<database-name>\" TO ROLE atlan_user_role;\n\n```\n\nReplace `<database-name>` with the database you want to be able to preview and query in Atlan. (Repeat the statements for every database you want to preview and query in Atlan.)\n\ndanger\n\nVerify that all the assets you'd like to crawl are present in these grants by [checking the grants](https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/data-warehouses/snowflake/troubleshooting/troubleshooting-snowflake-connectivity) on the user role defined for the crawler.\n\n## Grant permissions for information schema method [‚Äã](https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/data-warehouses/snowflake/how-tos/set-up-snowflake\\#grant-permissions-for-information-schema-method \"Direct link to Grant permissions for information schema method\")\n\nThis method uses views in the `INFORMATION_SCHEMA` schema in Snowflake databases to fetch metadata. You still need to grant specific permissions to enable Atlan to crawl metadata, preview data, and query data with this method.\n\n### To crawl existing assets [‚Äã](https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/data-warehouses/snowflake/how-tos/set-up-snowflake\\#to-crawl-existing-assets \"Direct link to To crawl existing assets\")\n\nGrant these permissions to crawl assets that already exist in Snowflake. If you also want to be able to preview and query the data, you can use the preview and query existing assets permissions instead.\n\n- Grant permissions to crawl existing assets:\n\n```codeBlockLines_e6Vv\nGRANT USAGE ON DATABASE \"<database-name>\" TO ROLE atlan_user_role;\nGRANT USAGE ON ALL SCHEMAS IN DATABASE \"<database-name>\" TO ROLE atlan_user_role;\nGRANT REFERENCES ON ALL TABLES IN DATABASE \"<database-name>\" TO ROLE atlan_user_role;\nGRANT REFERENCES ON ALL EXTERNAL TABLES IN DATABASE \"<database-name>\" TO ROLE atlan_user_role;\nGRANT REFERENCES ON ALL VIEWS IN DATABASE \"<database-name>\" TO ROLE atlan_user_role;\nGRANT REFERENCES ON ALL MATERIALIZED VIEWS IN DATABASE \"<database-name>\" TO ROLE atlan_user_role;\nGRANT SELECT ON ALL STREAMS IN DATABASE \"<database-name>\" TO ROLE atlan_user_role;\nGRANT MONITOR ON PIPE \"<pipe-name>\" TO ROLE atlan_user_role;\n\n```\n\nReplace `<database-name>` with the database you want to be available in Atlan. (Repeat the statements for every database you wish to integrate into Atlan.)\n\n- Grant permissions to crawl functions:\n\n```codeBlockLines_e6Vv\nGRANT USAGE ON ALL FUNCTIONS IN DATABASE \"<database-name>\" TO ROLE atlan_user_role;\n\n```\n\nReplace `<database-name>` with the database you want to be available in Atlan. (Repeat the statements for every database you wish to integrate into Atlan.)\n\n- For secure user-defined functions (UDFs), grant **OWNERSHIP** permissions to retrieve metadata:\n\n```codeBlockLines_e6Vv\nGRANT OWNERSHIP ON FUNCTION <schema_name>.<udf_name> TO ROLE <role_name>;\n\n```\n\nReplace the placeholders with the appropriate values:\n\n- `<schema_name>`: The name of the schema that contains the user-defined function (UDF).\n- `<udf_name>`: The name of the secure UDF that requires ownership permissions.\n- `<role_name>`: The role that gets assigned ownership of the secure UDF.\n\n**Did you know?**\n\nThe statements given on this page apply to all schemas, tables, and views in a database in Snowflake. If you want to limit access to only certain objects, you can instead specify the exact objects individually as well.\n\n### To crawl future assets [‚Äã](https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/data-warehouses/snowflake/how-tos/set-up-snowflake\\#to-crawl-future-assets \"Direct link to To crawl future assets\")\n\nTo crawl assets that may be created in the future in Snowflake, add these permissions.

We built Atlan for ourselves over the course of 200 data projects, which included India's national data platform used by the prime minister and monitoring the Sustainable Development Goals with the United Nations.\n\nAtlan helped us build India's national data platform with an 8-member team, making it the fastest project of its kind to go live in just 12 months - instead of the projected three years.\n\n## Why we built Atlan [‚Äã](https://docs.atlan.com/get-started/what-is-atlan\\#why-we-built-atlan \"Direct link to Why we built Atlan\")\n\nData teams can be diverse: analysts, scientists, engineers, and business users. Diverse people with diverse tools and skillsets mean diverse DNAs. All of it led to chaos, which made our Slack channels look like this...\n\n![mceclip0.png](https://docs.atlan.com/assets/images/mceclip0-cb7beffb0447ba62e4316c98555ec88c.png)\n\n### We call this \"collaboration overheard\" [‚Äã](https://docs.atlan.com/get-started/what-is-atlan\\#we-call-this-collaboration-overheard \"Direct link to We call this \\\"collaboration overheard\\\"\")\n\nWe knew we couldn't scale like this, there had to be a better way. We borrowed the principles of Agile from product teams, DevOps from engineering teams, and Lean Manufacturing from supply chain teams. We then experimented for two years and across 200 data projects to create our own idea of what makes data teams successful. We call this [DataOps](https://docs.atlan.com/get-started/references/the-dataops-culture-code).\n\n## How Atlan helps data teams [‚Äã](https://docs.atlan.com/get-started/what-is-atlan\\#how-atlan-helps-data-teams \"Direct link to How Atlan helps data teams\")\n\nWith Atlan, analyst teams at Unilever have shipped 100+ additional data projects per quarter, while data science teams at Samsung have saved 50% of their time.\n\n### Create self-service ecosystems by reducing dependencies [‚Äã](https://docs.atlan.com/get-started/what-is-atlan\\#create-self-service-ecosystems-by-reducing-dependencies \"Direct link to Create self-service ecosystems by reducing dependencies\")\n\nAtlan makes all your data assets easily discoverable. No more Slack messages like \"Where's that dataset?\" or long email threads for approvals. With Atlan, you can simply Cmd+K your way to the right data asset.\n\n**Key capabilities**: [discovery and search](https://docs.atlan.com/product/capabilities/discovery/how-tos/search-and-discover-assets), [Visual Query Builder](https://docs.atlan.com/product/capabilities/insights/how-tos/query-data#use-the-visual-query-builder), [saved queries](https://docs.atlan.com/product/capabilities/insights/how-tos/save-and-share-queries), [READMEs](https://docs.atlan.com/product/integrations)\n\n### Improve the agility of your data team [‚Äã](https://docs.atlan.com/get-started/what-is-atlan\\#improve-the-agility-of-your-data-team \"Direct link to Improve the agility of your data team\")\n\nData practitioners spend 30-50% of their time finding and understanding data. Atlan cuts that time by 95%. Your data team will be shipping 2-3 times more projects in no time.\n\n**Key capabilities**: visibility of [data quality](https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/observability/monte-carlo/how-tos/set-up-monte-carlo) tests and observability alerts, [automated lineage](https://docs.atlan.com/product/capabilities/lineage/concepts/what-is-lineage), [Atlan AI](https://docs.atlan.com/product/capabilities/atlan-ai/concepts/what-is-atlan-ai)\n\n### Promote governance and a sustainable data culture [‚Äã](https://docs.atlan.com/get-started/what-is-atlan\\#promote-governance-and-a-sustainable-data-culture \"Direct link to Promote governance and a sustainable data culture\")\n\nDon't lose sleep trying to figure out if your sensitive data is secure. Build ecosystems of trust, make your team happy, and let Atlan manage governance and security behind the scenes.\n\n**Key capabilities**: [tag sensitive data](https://docs.atlan.com/product/capabilities/governance/tags/how-tos/attach-a-tag), [granular access control](https://docs.atlan.com/product/capabilities/governance/custom-metadata/how-tos/control-access-metadata-data), [data products](https://docs.atlan.com/product/capabilities/data-products/concepts/what-are-data-products)\n\n- [Why we built Atlan](https://docs.atlan.com/get-started/what-is-atlan#why-we-built-atlan)\n- [How Atlan helps data teams](https://docs.atlan.com/get-started/what-is-atlan#how-atlan-helps-data-teams)\n\n‚úï\n\nHi there, I'm Ask AI.

All the while ensuring that product releases are mature and stable to truly empower users.\n\nAtlan follows a standard CI/CD model - continuous integration (CI) and continuous delivery (CD) - for [deploying product updates](https://docs.atlan.com/platform/references/quality-assurance-framework). This includes bug fixes and making improvements regularly.\n\nTo minimize risks and enhance security, each component in Atlan is tracked and released individually. When developers make changes, a series of automated validations are initiated, including building component images, running tests, and verifying that no vulnerabilities have been introduced. Peer reviews further ensure high-quality standards.\n\nOnly after the changes have been approved, the new release will go through the following stages:\n\n1. Staging - for pre-production testing\n2. Beta - for limited user testing\n3. Production - live environment release\n\nAtlan's engineering team actively reviews any issues with new releases to extract valuable insights and learning opportunities toward offering a better service. Accordingly, Atlan recommends that any connections or integrations you would like to make must be approved by Atlan unless already tested and documented. Note that any unauthorized integration may lead to breakdown of service and impact end user experience.\n\nSignificant feature updates are always highlighted within the application.

However, you can share the token with anyone to give them programmatic access.\n\nGenerate API token\n\nA\n\nGenerate API token\n\n![Begin by navigating to the admin center](https://cdn.arcade.software/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,dpr=2,width=3840/extension-uploads/Fvev3AJ55XGz7DICEYdJ/image/2f970e45-269b-4334-a5a7-ad219a67ef18.png)![API tokens are managed from here](<Base64-Image-Removed>)\n\nInteractive walkthrough\n\nTo create a bearer token:\n\n1. From the left menu of any screen, click **Admin**.\n2. Under _Workspace_, click **API tokens**.\n3. In the upper right of the _API tokens_ table, click the **Generate API token** button and enter the following details:\n1. For _Name_, enter a name for your API token - for example, the system or application that will use this token.\n2. (Optional) For _Description_, enter a description for your API token - for example, its intended use. You can also add or change the description later.\n3. (Optional) For _Personas_, select any [asset-level permissions](https://docs.atlan.com/product/capabilities/governance/access-control/concepts/what-are-personas) you want to give to the token. You can also add these later.\n4. (Optional) For _Collections_, select any [query collections](https://docs.atlan.com/product/capabilities/insights/how-tos/save-and-share-queries) you want to provide access to the token. You can also add these later.\n5. (Optional) If you would like the token to be temporary, for _Expiry_, choose the time after which the token should automatically become invalid.\n6. At the bottom right, click the **Save** button.\n7. (Optional) If and when you no longer need your API token, on an active token's row, click the trash icon to delete your API token and then click the **Delete** button to confirm deletion.\n\ndanger\n\nRemember to copy or download the token now - this is your only opportunity to do so. (If you've already forgotten, just delete the API token and create a new one.)\n\n## Use the bearer token [‚Äã](https://docs.atlan.com/get-started/references/api-authentication\\#use-the-bearer-token \"Direct link to Use the bearer token\")\n\nYou must authenticate all requests to Atlan's APIs. You can authenticate your requests by sending the following header:\n\n```codeBlockLines_e6Vv\nAuthorization: Bearer <token>\n\n```\n\nSo, for example, if the API token you copied had the value `eyJhbGciOi...`, you would use the header:\n\n```codeBlockLines_e6Vv\nAuthorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOi...\n\n```\n\ndanger\n\nNote that the value of the `Authorization` header is the combination of the word `Bearer`, a space, and then the token's value. The token copied from Atlan does not include this `Bearer` prefix.\n\n## Token permissions [‚Äã](https://docs.atlan.com/get-started/references/api-authentication\\#token-permissions \"Direct link to Token permissions\")\n\nBy default, each API token will have the permissions of an [admin user](https://docs.atlan.com/product/capabilities/governance/users-and-groups/concepts/what-are-user-roles), _without_ connection admin privileges. This means the token is able to:\n\n- Call administrative API endpoints. For example, to create users and groups.\n- Call governance API endpoints. For example, to create governance objects like tags, custom metadata, personas and purposes.\n\ndanger\n\nThe API token will only be able to access connections (and assets within them) that the token itself created. Even connections with _All Admins_ set as connection admins will not be accessible by the token, without a persona assigned to the token.\n\nTo provide access to any connections and assets, you need to add one or more [personas](https://docs.atlan.com/product/capabilities/governance/access-control/concepts/what-are-personas) to the token that have access to that connection's assets.\n\nOnce personas are assigned to the token, the token will be able to:\n\n- Create, read, update, delete, and search glossaries (and their content) that are accessible by those assigned personas.\n- Create, read, update, delete, and search any assets that are accessible by those personas.\n\n- [Use the bearer token](https://docs.atlan.com/get-started/references/api-authentication#use-the-bearer-token)\n- [Token permissions](https://docs.atlan.com/get-started/references/api-authentication#token-permissions)",

We borrowed the principles of Agile from product teams, DevOps from engineering teams, and Lean Manufacturing from supply chain teams.\n\nWe then experimented for two years, across 200 data projects, to create our own idea of what makes data teams successful. These principles are the foundation of everything we build at Atlan.\n\n## The DataOps Culture Code [‚Äã](https://docs.atlan.com/get-started/references/the-dataops-culture-code\\#the-dataops-culture-code \"Direct link to The DataOps Culture Code\")\n\n### ü§ù¬† It‚Äôs a team sport, and collaboration is key [‚Äã](https://docs.atlan.com/get-started/references/the-dataops-culture-code\\#-its-a-team-sport-and-collaboration-is-key \"Direct link to ü§ù¬† It‚Äôs a team sport, and collaboration is key\")\n\nData teams will always have a variety of roles, each with their own skills, favorite tools and DNA. Embrace the diversity, and create mechanisms for effective collaboration.\n\n### üóÑ Treat data, code, models and dashboards as assets.

But that creates trust deficiencies - especially when things go wrong!\n\nIntentionally create systems of trust in your team.\n\n- Make everyone‚Äôs work accessible and discoverable to break down \"tool\" silos.\n\n- Create transparency in data pipelines and lineage so everyone can see and troubleshoot issues.\n\n- Set up monitoring and alerting systems to proactively know when things break.\n\n\n### üñáÔ∏è Create a plug-and-play data stack [‚Äã](https://docs.atlan.com/get-started/references/the-dataops-culture-code\\#%EF%B8%8F-create-a-plug-and-play-data-stack \"Direct link to üñáÔ∏è Create a plug-and-play data stack\")\n\nThe data ecosystem will rapidly evolve. The tools, technology and infrastructure you use today will (and should) be different from the tools you use two years later.\n\nYour data stack should allow your team to experiment and innovate as technology evolves, without creating lock-ins.\n\n- Embrace tools that are open and extensible.\n\n- Leverage a strong metadata layer to tie diverse tooling together.\n\n\n### ‚ú®¬† User experience defines adoption velocity [‚Äã](https://docs.atlan.com/get-started/references/the-dataops-culture-code\\#-user-experience-defines-adoption-velocity \"Direct link to ‚ú®¬† User experience defines adoption velocity\")\n\nEmployees at [Airbnb](https://www.slideshare.net/neo4j/graphconnect-europe-2017-democratizing-data-at-airbnb) famously said, \"Designing the interface and user experience of a data tool should not be an afterthought.\"\n\nWithout good user experience, the best tools or most thoughtful processes won't be adopted in your team.\n\nInvest in user experience, even for internal tools.

Admins can [invite new users](https://docs.atlan.com/product/capabilities/governance/users-and-groups/how-tos/invite-new-users) to log into Atlan. When a new user opens the invitation link, they will be able to set up their user profile, including username and password.\n\nHowever, Atlan does not recommend using basic authentication. Instead, admins should configure and enforce [SSO authentication](https://docs.atlan.com/product/integrations/identity-management/sso).\n\n## SSO authentication [‚Äã](https://docs.atlan.com/platform/concepts/authentication-and-authorization\\#sso-authentication \"Direct link to SSO authentication\")\n\n### SSO using SAML 2.0 [‚Äã](https://docs.atlan.com/platform/concepts/authentication-and-authorization\\#sso-using-saml-20 \"Direct link to SSO using SAML 2.0\")\n\nAtlan supports single sign-on (SSO), allowing admins to configure SSO authentication.\n\nAtlan currently supports the following SSO providers:\n\n- [Azure AD](https://docs.atlan.com/product/integrations/identity-management/sso/how-tos/enable-azure-ad-for-sso)\n- [Google](https://docs.atlan.com/product/integrations/identity-management/sso/how-tos/enable-google-for-sso)\n- [JumpCloud](https://docs.atlan.com/product/integrations/identity-management/sso/how-tos/enable-jumpcloud-for-sso)\n- [Okta](https://docs.atlan.com/product/integrations/identity-management/sso/how-tos/enable-okta-for-sso)\n- [OneLogin](https://docs.atlan.com/product/integrations/identity-management/sso/how-tos/enable-onelogin-for-sso)\n- [Custom IdP](https://docs.atlan.com/product/integrations/identity-management/sso/how-tos/enable-saml-2-0-for-sso)\n\n### SSO using SCIM [‚Äã](https://docs.atlan.com/platform/concepts/authentication-and-authorization\\#sso-using-scim \"Direct link to SSO using SCIM\")\n\n[System for Cross-domain Identity Management¬†(SCIM) provisioning](https://docs.atlan.com/product/integrations/identity-management/scim/how-tos/configure-scim-provisioning) works in combination with SSO.

Access rights are assigned based on roles, and users are granted permissions according to their responsibilities. A system owner or an authorized party must approve any additional permissions.\n\nAtlan adheres to the principle of least privilege, ensuring that users are only granted the level of access necessary to perform their job functions.\n\n### User access review (UAR) [‚Äã](https://docs.atlan.com/platform/concepts/authentication-and-authorization\\#user-access-review-uar \"Direct link to User access review (UAR)\")\n\nAtlan recommends that admins perform¬†access reviews of users, admins, and service accounts on a quarterly basis to ensure that appropriate access levels are maintained. Access reviews should also be documented.\n\n## Identity and access management [‚Äã](https://docs.atlan.com/platform/concepts/authentication-and-authorization\\#identity-and-access-management \"Direct link to Identity and access management\")\n\nFor centralized management of groups and users, Atlan uses granular [access policies](https://docs.atlan.com/platform/concepts/authentication-and-authorization#).\n\nAdmins can define policies to control both which actions a user can take and against which assets. These can be as broad as entire databases down to individual columns. Organizations can even build policies based on asset classification. This opens up the ability to restrict access to sensitive data like Personally Identifiable Information (PII) - an essential feature in the GDPR era.\n\nAtlan [denies access by default](https://docs.atlan.com/product/capabilities/governance/custom-metadata/how-tos/control-access-metadata-data), and [explicit denials override any grants](https://docs.atlan.com/product/capabilities/governance/custom-metadata/how-tos/control-access-metadata-data#explicit-restrictions-denies-take-priority). You can even deny admin users access to assets, if you want.\n\n### Roles [‚Äã](https://docs.atlan.com/platform/concepts/authentication-and-authorization\\#roles \"Direct link to Roles\")\n\nYou must assign every user in Atlan a [user role](https://docs.atlan.com/product/capabilities/governance/users-and-groups/concepts/what-are-user-roles). These control basic levels of access.\n\n### Groups [‚Äã](https://docs.atlan.com/platform/concepts/authentication-and-authorization\\#groups \"Direct link to Groups\")\n\nYou can also add users to [groups](https://docs.atlan.com/product/capabilities/governance/users-and-groups/concepts/what-are-groups). Groups provide a more maintainable mechanism for applying access controls.\n\n### Policies [‚Äã](https://docs.atlan.com/platform/concepts/authentication-and-authorization\\#policies \"Direct link to Policies\")\n\nYou can define [access policies](https://docs.atlan.com/product/capabilities/governance/custom-metadata/how-tos/control-access-metadata-data#access-policies) for both users and groups.\n\nThrough these policies you can restrict which users can take which actions on which assets.\n\nFor example, you can set up [tags](https://docs.atlan.com/product/capabilities/governance/tags/concepts/what-are-tags) such as PII and apply this to data assets like tables. You can also configure the tag to propagate downstream to any columns or tables created from them.\n\nYou can then define [access controls based on these tags](https://docs.atlan.com/product/capabilities/governance/access-control/concepts/what-are-purposes#granular-data-protection) to restrict access to tagged assets. If Atlan propagates tags for you to derived assets, the access control is automatically applied to those derived assets as well.\n\n- [Basic authentication](https://docs.atlan.com/platform/concepts/authentication-and-authorization#basic-authentication)\n- [SSO authentication](https://docs.atlan.com/platform/concepts/authentication-and-authorization#sso-authentication)\n- [Authorization](https://docs.atlan.com/platform/concepts/authentication-and-authorization#authorization)\n- [Identity and access management](https://docs.atlan.com/platform/concepts/authentication-and-authorization#identity-and-access-management)\n\n‚úï\n\nHi there, I'm Ask AI.

Atlan crawls _metadata_ from upstream data sources and stores it in a secure VPC (virtual private cloud).\n\nAtlan pushes any queries to existing processing layers. For example, directly to your database, warehouse, or a processing layer such as Athena or Presto on top of blob storage. So the _data_ itself stays put - Atlan does not move or store it.\n\nNot sure on the difference between _data_ and _metadata_? Try our [helpful primer](https://atlan.com/data-vs-metadata/).\n\n## Data previews and queries [‚Äã](https://docs.atlan.com/platform/concepts/data-and-metadata-persistence\\#data-previews-and-queries \"Direct link to Data previews and queries\")\n\nAtlan gives users the ability to see sample data previews for a data asset as well as the results for any queries run on Atlan.\n\nIn both cases, Atlan pushes the request upstream to the data source, and shows a 100-row sample of the result to Atlan users. Atlan does not cache any of this data. So each time a user previews or queries data, it is re-queried from the source.\n\nEvery time a user runs a query, Atlan streams query results in batches directly from your data source. Since the data is streamed in real-time from the data source, there is no need to persist the query results in Atlan's cache or storage layer. This ensures that the data displayed is always up to date and accurate, eliminating the need for storing intermediate query results.\n\n## Metadata storage [‚Äã](https://docs.atlan.com/platform/concepts/data-and-metadata-persistence\\#metadata-storage \"Direct link to Metadata storage\")\n\nAtlan stores the metadata it collects and creates in applications and databases within the VPC. This includes:\n\n- asset metadata\n- user data\n\n### Asset metadata [‚Äã](https://docs.atlan.com/platform/concepts/data-and-metadata-persistence\\#asset-metadata \"Direct link to Asset metadata\")\n\nAtlan stores asset metadata, including lineage, in:\n\n- Apache Atlas, a graph database layer that stores entity relationships and attributes\n- Elasticsearch, to optimize search on the product\n- Cassandra, as the persistence back-end\n\n### User data [‚Äã](https://docs.atlan.com/platform/concepts/data-and-metadata-persistence\\#user-data \"Direct link to User data\")\n\nAtlan stores data on users, roles, and groups in its own PostgreSQL database. Keycloak uses this information for access and identity management.\n\nAtlan hashes all sensitive fields like passwords and stores them securely.

All the EBS (Elastic Block Storage) launched by Atlan is encrypted. Atlan uses encrypted storage classes to provision persistent volumes to the microservices running inside the Kubernetes cluster.\n\n## Key and credential management [‚Äã](https://docs.atlan.com/platform/concepts/encryption-and-key-management\\#key-and-credential-management \"Direct link to Key and credential management\")\n\nAtlan uses [HashiCorp Vault](https://www.vaultproject.io/) to manage the following:\n\n- Keys - Vault manages encryption keys to encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit.\n- Secrets¬† - Vault encrypts and securely stores secrets such as API keys, tokens, and credentials.\n- Passwords - passwords are hashed and stored encrypted.\n\n## Data in transit [‚Äã](https://docs.atlan.com/platform/concepts/encryption-and-key-management\\#data-in-transit \"Direct link to Data in transit\")\n\nAtlan uses standard encryption to protect data in transit.\n\nAtlan uses hypertext transfer protocol secure (HTTPS) for secure communication when data is in transit. This protocol is encrypted using Transport Layer Security (TLS).\n\nTwo-factor authentication (2FA) is also supported for accessing resources.\n\n## Data at rest [‚Äã](https://docs.atlan.com/platform/concepts/encryption-and-key-management\\#data-at-rest \"Direct link to Data at rest\")\n\nData-At-Rest Encryption (DARE) is the encryption of data stored in different storage components and not moving through networks.\n\n### Cloud storage [‚Äã](https://docs.atlan.com/platform/concepts/encryption-and-key-management\\#cloud-storage \"Direct link to Cloud storage\")\n\nAtlan encrypts the data at rest in different cloud resources like volumes and cloud storage using cloud provider-managed keys.\n\n- Amazon S3 - Atlan uses [server-side encryption with Amazon S3 managed keys (SSE-S3)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/UsingServerSideEncryption.html) to encrypt the data at rest in Amazon S3. This encryption uses 256-bit Advanced Encryption Standard Galois/Counter Mode (AES-GCM) to encrypt all uploaded objects.\n- Azure Blob Storage - Atlan uses [Microsoft-managed keys](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-service-encryption) to encrypt the data at rest in Azure Blob Storage. This encryption uses 256-bit AES encryption and is FIPS 140-2 compliant.\n- Google Cloud Storage - Atlan uses [Google-managed keys](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/encryption/default-keys) to encrypt the data at rest in Google Cloud Storage. This encryption uses AES-256 using Galois/Counter Mode (GCM) to encrypt all uploaded objects.\n\n### Volumes [‚Äã](https://docs.atlan.com/platform/concepts/encryption-and-key-management\\#volumes \"Direct link to Volumes\")\n\nVolumes are used by the StatefulSet running in the tenants. These volumes are encrypted at rest by the cloud provider-managed keys.\n\n- Amazon Web Services (AWS) - Atlan uses the default [Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) encryption](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ebs/latest/userguide/ebs-encryption.html) for encrypting the data at rest in all the volumes. Amazon EBS encrypts volume with a data key using industry-standard AES-256 data encryption.\n- Microsoft Azure - Atlan uses [Azure Storage encryption](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/disk-encryption), which uses server-side encryption (SSE), for encrypting the data at rest in all the volumes. Data in Azure managed disks is encrypted transparently using 256-bit AES encryption, one of the strongest block ciphers available, and is FIPS 140-2 compliant.\n- Google Cloud Platform (GCP) - Atlan uses Google-managed encryption to encrypt the data at rest in all the volumes.

It automatically scales control plane instances based on load, detects and replaces unhealthy control plane instances, and patches the control plane.\n\nThe benefits of using this concept are:\n\n- Scalability and reliability help the system remain stable\n- Promotes self-healing to ensure that containers are running in a healthy state\n- Handles node failures gracefully\n- Auto-scaling enables automated cluster creation\n\n### Application HA [‚Äã](https://docs.atlan.com/platform/concepts/high-availability-and-disaster-recovery-ha-dr\\#application-ha \"Direct link to Application HA\")\n\nAtlan ensures application HA through the following:\n\n- Multiple replicas for both stateless and stateful applications\n- Load balancing with services\n- Rolling updates to maintain the availability threshold\n- Pod-to-node distribution to ensure that critical application pods are running on dedicated nodes\n- Usage of inter-Availability Zone (AZ) data transfers to avoid single-zone failure impact\n\n## Disaster recovery (DR) [‚Äã](https://docs.atlan.com/platform/concepts/high-availability-and-disaster-recovery-ha-dr\\#disaster-recovery-dr \"Direct link to Disaster recovery (DR)\")\n\nAtlan follows industry best practices for disaster recovery. Atlan uses Argo Workflows for orchestration to successfully implement a disaster recovery strategy and reduce production downtime, so that business impact is minimized in the event of an outage.\n\nIf a disaster is detected, the Disaster Assessment Team - comprising key stakeholders from IT, platform, operations, and support - will be promptly notified through Atlan‚Äôs established communication channels. The team will conduct a thorough evaluation to determine the extent of the damage and prioritize remediation based on an internal list of critical services and applications.\n\nIn case of a disaster, a tenant will be recreated, and the following actions performed to restore the tenant:\n\n- Onboard a new tenant with no data and a different domain.\n- Use Argo Workflows to restore the data from last backup.\n- Scale down the previous tenant.\n- Change the domain of the new tenant to that of the previous one.\n- Update the Cloudflare record with the load balancer of the newly onboarded tenant.\n\nAll the aforementioned action items are automated. The entire process of restoring all the components of a tenant from backup takes around 3-4 hours. In case of data loss for any particular component, it can also be recovered from the last backup.\n\nHere are a few parameters that help reduce downtime and expedite the process of disaster recovery:\n\n### Infrastructure [‚Äã](https://docs.atlan.com/platform/concepts/high-availability-and-disaster-recovery-ha-dr\\#infrastructure \"Direct link to Infrastructure\")\n\n[Single-tenant SaaS](https://docs.atlan.com/platform/references/atlan-architecture) is the default deployment option for most Atlan users. In this model, Atlan manages the infrastructure needs and ensures that all instances are spread across multiple [Availability Zones](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-regions-availability-zones.html) (AZ) in each AWS Region where the user instance is deployed.\n\nAvailability Zones are multiple, isolated locations within a single AWS Region. [Multi-AZ](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/real-time-communication-on-aws/use-multiple-availability-zones.html) deployments provide enhanced availability for instances within a single AWS Region. With multi-AZ, your data is synchronously replicated to standby in a different Availability Zone.\n\ndanger\n\nAtlan currently does not support multi-region deployment.\n\n### Atlan service overview [‚Äã](https://docs.atlan.com/platform/concepts/high-availability-and-disaster-recovery-ha-dr\\#atlan-service-overview \"Direct link to Atlan service overview\")\n\nThe diagram below illustrates the relationships and communication flows between each service.¬†The bottom-most layer shows the services that are entirely independent, such as Cassandra, Postgres, and more. Most of the other services depend on these to function.\n\n[![](https://docs.atlan.com/assets/images/7887835262749-23be9ba9e414a4911c1b469ab608d138.png)](https://ask.atlan.com/hc/article_attachments/7887835262749)\n\n### Backups and restore [‚Äã](https://docs.atlan.com/platform/concepts/high-availability-and-disaster-recovery-ha-dr\\#backups-and-restore \"Direct link to Backups and restore\")\n\nAtlan runs an automated daily backup of each tenant. By default, the backup is scheduled at 3:00 AM UTC, configurable as per the requirement of an organization.\n\nThe backup of each tenant is stored in its respective cloud storage. The backups are encrypted at rest by the default cloud provider key. This key uses the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) 256 algorithm. Since Atlan uses the cloud provider key, the key is rotated by the cloud provider.\n\nAtlan controls access to the cloud storage where the backup is stored, and only provides access in case of troubleshooting an issue. Each backup process captures a full backup of all the data, with no incremental backups being performed. Atlan also monitors the backup to ensure that backups are not skipped. Alerts are generated in case a backup run fails for the support team to examine the issue.\n\nThe lifecycle policy for backups in the cloud provider is set to 15 days, which means Atlan will retain backups for all the components for 15 days.\n\nBackups of the following components are taken on a daily basis:\n\n- Argo Workflows\n- Elasticsearch\n- Cassandra\n- Redis\n- Postgres\n\nAtlan can restore a single component in case of data corruption for any single point of failure, such as a metastore and its components like Elasticsearch and Cassandra. It is also possible to do a full-cluster restore in case of an unintended operation or a data loss or corruption event.\n\n**Did you know?**\n\n[Argo Workflows](https://argoproj.github.io/workflows/) powers all the backup and restore packages in Atlan. It includes a retry mechanism in case of any errors while completing the steps in the workflow. It also sends alerts in case of entire package failure as part of observability.\n\n### Migration [‚Äã](https://docs.atlan.com/platform/concepts/high-availability-and-disaster-recovery-ha-dr\\#migration \"Direct link to Migration\")\n\nAtlan has an easy process to migrate the application to other AWS Regions. In case of total region outage and the need for migrating an instance to another region or account, this migration activity will be performed via Atlan‚Äôs backup and restore packages.\n\n## RTO, RPO, and retention [‚Äã](https://docs.atlan.com/platform/concepts/high-availability-and-disaster-recovery-ha-dr\\#rto-rpo-and-retention \"Direct link to RTO, RPO, and retention\")\n\nGreater RTOs and RPOs as well as system recovery are crucial for ensuring that multiple mission-critical applications are quickly restored. It is now possible to minimize the impact of a disruption and perform a recovery within a few hours of an outage.\n\n- Atlan carries out a daily backup of all critical services once every 24 hours, so in a worst case scenario provides an RPO of 24 hours.\n- For all critical applications, RTO is less than 3 hours.\n- Atlan retains daily backups for 15 days.\n\n## Post-recovery validation [‚Äã](https://docs.atlan.com/platform/concepts/high-availability-and-disaster-recovery-ha-dr\\#post-recovery-validation \"Direct link to Post-recovery validation\")\n\nThe following post-recovery actions are performed:\n\n- Post restoration, Atlan conducts data integrity checks to ensure that the restored data is accurate and complete.\n- Atlan performs system tests to confirm that all components of the tenant are functioning correctly after restoration.\n\n- [High availability (HA)](https://docs.atlan.com/platform/concepts/high-availability-and-disaster-recovery-ha-dr#high-availability-ha)\n- [Disaster recovery (DR)](https://docs.atlan.com/platform/concepts/high-availability-and-disaster-recovery-ha-dr#disaster-recovery-dr)\n- [RTO, RPO, and retention](https://docs.atlan.com/platform/concepts/high-availability-and-disaster-recovery-ha-dr#rto-rpo-and-retention)\n- [Post-recovery validation](https://docs.atlan.com/platform/concepts/high-availability-and-disaster-recovery-ha-dr#post-recovery-validation)\n\n‚úï\n\nHi there, I'm Ask AI.

This enables you to monitor login events and integrate logs with security information and event management (SIEM) systems for real-time security monitoring and alerts.\n\n## Key aspects [‚Äã](https://docs.atlan.com/platform/references/cloud-logging-and-monitoring\\#key-aspects \"Direct link to Key aspects\")\n\n- Log format and structure: The OTLP format ensures seamless integration with SIEM systems, and logs are organized by date and event type. Logs are stored in a compressed format in your organization's preferred object storage (S3 or GCS). Once uncompressed, the logs will be available in a JSON file format containing multiple log entries.\n\n- Each file is saved for an hour in the following folder structure in gzip:\n\n\n\n\n\n```codeBlockLines_e6Vv\n/year=YYYY/month=MM/day=DD/hour=HH/logs_<rnd-9-digit-int>.json.gz\n\n```\n\n- The JSON file structure is as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n```codeBlockLines_e6Vv\n{\n      \"resourceLogs\": [\\\n          {\\\n              \"resource\": {\\\n                  \"attributes\": [ // k8s metadata\\\n                  ]\\\n              },\\\n              \"scopeLogs\": [\\\n                  {\\\n                      \"scope\": {},\\\n                      \"logRecords\": [\\\n                          {\\\n                              \"timeUnixNano\": \"1725861538220747913\",\\\n                              \"observedTimeUnixNano\": \"1726071786185095727\",\\\n                              \"body\": {\\\n                                  \"stringValue\": \"//redacted logline\"\\\n                              },\\\n                              \"traceId\": \"\",\\\n                              \"spanId\": \"\"\\\n                          }\\\n                      ]\\\n                  },\\\n                  {...},\\\n              ]\\\n          },\\\n          {\\\n              \"resource\": {...},\\\n              \"scopeLogs\": [...]\\\n          }\\\n      ]\n}\n\n```\n\n\n- Secure delivery- Logs are encrypted in transit and at rest, with mechanisms to validate data integrity.\n\n- Customer access: Logs are easily accessible through S3 or GCS, allowing for a flexible monitoring and alerting setup.\n\n\n## Enabling event logs in AWS [‚Äã](https://docs.atlan.com/platform/references/cloud-logging-and-monitoring\\#enabling-event-logs-in-aws \"Direct link to Enabling event logs in AWS\")\n\n![AWS Keycloak Event Logs](https://docs.atlan.com/assets/images/AWS_KeycloakEventLogs-7ce1cbd96c68575ac4c297bdd9c7223a.png)\n\n### Prerequisites [‚Äã](https://docs.atlan.com/platform/references/cloud-logging-and-monitoring\\#prerequisites \"Direct link to Prerequisites\")\n\n- Enable bucket versioning. Both source and destination buckets must have versioning enabled. See [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/replication-requirements.html).\n- Customer-provided bucket details: account ID, bucket name, and region.\n- Atlan will use these details to create an IAM role on the Atlan side and then provide you with the bucket policy to be attached.\n- Once you have confirmed that the bucket policy has been attached, Atlan will complete the final step of setting up log replication. Atlan support will complete the configuration on the Atlan side.\n\nYou will need to attach the following policy to your destination bucket:\n\n```codeBlockLines_e6Vv\n{\n    \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\",\n    \"Id\": \"\",\n    \"Statement\": [\\\n        {\\\n            \"Sid\": \"Set-permissions-for-objects\",\\\n            \"Effect\": \"Allow\",\\\n            \"Principal\": {\\\n                \"AWS\": \"<Atlan Role ARN>\"\\\n            },\\\n            \"Action\": [\\\n                \"s3:ReplicateObject\",\\\n                \"s3:ReplicateDelete\",\\\n                \"s3:GetBucketVersioning\",\\\n                \"s3:PutBucketVersioning\"\\\n            ],\\\n            \"Resource\": [\\\n                \"arn:aws:s3:::<Customer S3 Bucket Name>/*\",\\\n                \"arn:aws:s3:::<Customer S3 Bucket Name>\"\\\n            ]\\\n        }\\\n    ]\n}\n\n```\n\n### Continuous replication to S3 bucket [‚Äã](https://docs.atlan.com/platform/references/cloud-logging-and-monitoring\\#continuous-replication-to-s3-bucket \"Direct link to Continuous replication to S3 bucket\")\n\nApplication audit logs are streamed to Atlan's S3 bucket in near real time ‚Äî within 10 seconds of being generated. This is a continuous process. Once the logs are available in Atlan's bucket, the logs will be replicated to your organization's S3 bucket within 15 minutes. The replication is ongoing and occurs without delays. This ensures that logs are continuously transferred as they are generated, with no waiting period between replications.\n\n## Enabling event logs in GCP [‚Äã](https://docs.atlan.com/platform/references/cloud-logging-and-monitoring\\#enabling-event-logs-in-gcp \"Direct link to Enabling event logs in GCP\")\n\n![GCP Keycloak Events Logs](https://docs.atlan.com/assets/images/GCP_KeycloakEventsLogs-b05ba16a47e2204582ddf13f301fab7c.png)\n\nFor Google Cloud Platform (GCP), Atlan utilizes [Logs Router](https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/export/configure_export_v2) to transfer logs from the GCS bucket of your Atlan tenant to a destination bucket of your choice. The destination must be supported by the Logs Router.\n\n- The organization must provide details of the destination where the logs should be synced. This destination must be supported by the Logs Router.\n- Atlan will create a Log Router sink and provide you with a service account.\n- Depending on the selected destination, you will need to configure the necessary permissions for the service account as outlined in [Google documentation](https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/export/configure_export_v2#dest-auth).\n- Once you have configured the permissions, the logs will begin syncing to your preferred destination.\n\nNew sinks to Cloud Storage buckets may take several hours to start routing log entries. Sinks to Cloud Storage are processed hourly while other destination types are processed in real time.\n\n- [Key aspects](https://docs.atlan.com/platform/references/cloud-logging-and-monitoring#key-aspects)\n- [Enabling event logs in AWS](https://docs.atlan.com/platform/references/cloud-logging-and-monitoring#enabling-event-logs-in-aws)\n- [Enabling event logs in GCP](https://docs.atlan.com/platform/references/cloud-logging-and-monitoring#enabling-event-logs-in-gcp)\n\n‚úï\n\nHi there, I'm Ask AI.

Offboarding an Atlan vcluster tenant involves removing all the infrastructure resources associated with that particular tenant or instance.\n\nWhile most of the resources can be deleted immediately without any data loss, we handle the cleanup of storage resources like S3 buckets with care.\n\nS3 buckets associated with a tenant are not immediately removed - they are retained for 30 days after a tenant is offboarded. This ensures that there is a [disaster recovery mechanism](https://docs.atlan.com/platform/concepts/high-availability-and-disaster-recovery-ha-dr) in place if a tenant is offboarded by mistake or faces any unrecoverable errors.\n\n## Tenant decommissioning [‚Äã](https://docs.atlan.com/platform/references/tenant-offboarding\\#tenant-decommissioning \"Direct link to Tenant decommissioning\")\n\nYou can [raise a support ticket](https://docs.atlan.com/support/submit-request) for tenant decommissioning. The customer success team at Atlan will notify the infrastructure support team responsible for executing tenant offboarding. These requests are usually resolved within the first 48 hours to ensure that no unnecessary costs are incurred for infra resources.\n\n## Frequently asked questions [‚Äã](https://docs.atlan.com/platform/references/tenant-offboarding\\#frequently-asked-questions \"Direct link to Frequently asked questions\")\n\n#### Where is customer data stored? [‚Äã](https://docs.atlan.com/platform/references/tenant-offboarding\\#where-is-customer-data-stored \"Direct link to Where is customer data stored?\")\n\nAny customer-specific data in Atlan - for example, query logs, assets, service logs, and more - are stored in EBS volumes and S3 buckets.\n\n#### How long does customer data persist after tenant offboarding? [‚Äã](https://docs.atlan.com/platform/references/tenant-offboarding\\#how-long-does-customer-data-persist-after-tenant-offboarding \"Direct link to How long does customer data persist after tenant offboarding?\")\n\nEBS volumes are immediately deleted during offboarding.

Configure network access between your Secure Agent and Atlan tenant. For more information, see [Whitelisting Secure Agent](https://docs.atlan.com/secure-agent/references/security#whitelisting).\n\n2. You need Kubernetes version 1.19 or higher.\n\n3. You need to install Helm and kubectl on the machine you're using to connect to the AWS EKS cluster.\n\n4. You need at least 1 node for base services with a disk space of 20 GB and instance configuration as below:\n\n\n\n| Environment | Minimum instance type | Recommended instance type |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Production | t3.large | Custom based on workload |\n| Non-production | t3.large | t3.xlarge |\n\n\n\n\ninfo\n\n\n\n\n\nüí™ **Did you know?** For optimal autoscaling, scale nodes based on the number of concurrent workflows.\n\n\n## Permissions required [‚Äã](https://docs.atlan.com/secure-agent/how-tos/aws-eks/install-secure-agent-on-aws-eks\\#permissions-required \"Direct link to Permissions required\")\n\nBefore installing the Secure Agent, make sure the following permissions are in place:\n\n### Permissions for the Installer [‚Äã](https://docs.atlan.com/secure-agent/how-tos/aws-eks/install-secure-agent-on-aws-eks\\#permissions-for-the-installer \"Direct link to Permissions for the Installer\")\n\nThe user, service or system account performing the installation needs access to the EKS cluster and permissions to manage Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs).\n\n1. Ensure the kubeconfig is correctly configured for your target EKS cluster. If needed, use the following command to configure or update your kubeconfig file.\n\n\n\n\n\n```codeBlockLines_e6Vv\naws eks update-kubeconfig --region ``<region>`` --name ``<cluster-name>``\n\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   - Replace `<region>` with your AWS region (for example, us-east-1) and `<cluster-name>` with the name of your EKS cluster.\n2. The installer needs permission to create, update, and delete Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs). If not using the cluster-admin role, grant the following:\n\n\n- Create a file named `agent-crd-permissions.yaml` on your machine.\n\n- Copy the following content into the file:\n\n\n\n\n\n```codeBlockLines_e6Vv\napiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1\nkind: ClusterRole\nmetadata:\n    # Use a descriptive name\n    name: helm-crd-installer-role\nrules:\n- apiGroups: [\"apiextensions.k8s.io\"]\nresources: [\"customresourcedefinitions\"]\n# Recommended verbs for Helm CRD management\nverbs: [\"create\", \"get\", \"list\", \"watch\", \"update\", \"patch\", \"delete\"]\n---\napiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1\nkind: ClusterRoleBinding\nmetadata:\n# Use a descriptive name\nname: helm-crd-installer-binding\nsubjects:\n# *** IMPORTANT: Modify this section based on who is running Helm ***\n# Choose ONE of the following options and replace placeholders.\n# Option 1: Bind to a specific User\n- kind: User\nname: \"your-kubernetes-username\" # Replace with the installing user's K8s username recognized by the cluster\napiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io\n# Option 2: Bind to a specific Group\n# - kind: Group\n#   name: \"your-kubernetes-groupname\" # Replace with the installing user's K8s group name\n#   apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io\n# Option 3: Bind to a Service Account (e.g., for CI/CD pipelines)\n# - kind: ServiceAccount\n#   name: \"installer-sa-name\" # Replace with the installer SA's name\n#   namespace: \"installer-sa-namespace\" # Replace with the installer SA's namespace\nroleRef:\n# This refers to the ClusterRole created above\nkind: ClusterRole\nname: helm-crd-installer-role\napiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io\n\n```\n\nFollow the comments in the file to replace the placeholders. In the above file:\n  - Resource: `customresourcedefinitions` \\- needed for managing CRDs in the cluster.\n  - API Group: `apiextensions.k8s.io` \\- required to work with CRDs.\n  - Verbs: create, get, list, update, delete - necessary for installing, inspecting, updating, and cleaning up CRDs using Helm.\n  - ClusterRoleBinding: needed to assign the role to the user or group performing the installation.\n  - Once you‚Äôve updated the placeholders, use the below `kubectl` command to apply the configuration:\n\n4. Once you‚Äôve updated the placeholders, use the below kubectl command to apply the configuration:\n\n\n\n\n\n```codeBlockLines_e6Vv\nkubectl apply -f agent-crd-permissions.yaml\n\n```\n\n\n### Permissions for the Secure Agent Pod (Runtime) [‚Äã](https://docs.atlan.com/secure-agent/how-tos/aws-eks/install-secure-agent-on-aws-eks\\#permissions-for-the-secure-agent-pod-runtime \"Direct link to Permissions for the Secure Agent Pod (Runtime)\")\n\nThe Secure Agent runs as pods in your EKS cluster and requires permissions to interact with AWS services like S3. These permissions are granted through IAM Roles for Service Accounts (IRSA).\n\n1. Create a new IAM role for the Secure Agent pod.\n\n2. Configure the trust policy to enable the Secure Agent‚Äôs Kubernetes service account to assume the role. Make sure the argo-workflow service account exists in the same namespace where you plan to install the agent. For more information, see the AWS documentation on [IAM roles for service accounts (IRSA)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/iam-roles-for-service-accounts.html).\n   - Example: Trust policy for the argo-workflow service account:\n\n\n\n\n\n     ```codeBlockLines_e6Vv\n     \"Condition\": {\n       \"StringEquals\": {\n         \":sub\": \"system:serviceaccount::argo-workflow\"\n       }\n     }\n\n     ```\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n     Replace `<namespace>` with the namespace where you plan to install agent.\n\n   - Create an S3 bucket (or use an existing one), and attach the following permissions to the IAM role used by the Secure Agent:\n     - `s3:PutObject`: Needed to write logs and artifacts\n     - `s3:GetObject`: Needed to read logs and artifacts.\n     - `s3:ListBucket`: Needed by Argo artifact repository for listing objects.\n\n**Did you know?**\n\nThe Helm chart automatically configures the necessary Kubernetes RBAC for Argo Workflows, which the Secure Agent uses. No additional configuration is required for the Secure Agent pod..\n\n## Prerequisites [‚Äã](https://docs.atlan.com/secure-agent/how-tos/aws-eks/install-secure-agent-on-aws-eks\\#prerequisites \"Direct link to Prerequisites\")\n\nBefore proceeding, complete the following setup steps to prepare your Atlan tenant and AWS EKS cluster.\n\n### Configure Atlan tenant [‚Äã](https://docs.atlan.com/secure-agent/how-tos/aws-eks/install-secure-agent-on-aws-eks\\#configure-atlan-tenant \"Direct link to Configure Atlan tenant\")\n\nIn your Atlan tenant:\n\n1. Sign in as an Atlan admin.\n2. Go to **Admin** from the left menu.\n3. Under **Workspace**, click **Labs**.\n4. Navigate to **Workflow Center**.\n5. Enable the **Crawl assets using Secure Agent** toggle.\n\n### Configure Secure Agent settings [‚Äã](https://docs.atlan.com/secure-agent/how-tos/aws-eks/install-secure-agent-on-aws-eks\\#configure-secure-agent-settings \"Direct link to Configure Secure Agent settings\")\n\nThe `agent_config_values.yaml` file is used to configure the Secure Agent, Argo Workflows, and storage for the AWS EKS cluster. Follow these instructions on the machine where you're performing the installation.\n\n1. Create a file named `agent_config_values.yaml` file.\n\n2. Copy the configuration below into the file:\n\n\n\n\n\n```codeBlockLines_e6Vv\n# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n# Agent core settings   -  Follow the comments to update:\n# 1.

In the configuration file, follow the comments to replace the necessary attributes. You may want to update the below configurations if:\n   - _You are using a private image registry (Image registry settings)_\n   - _You want the agent to use an S3 bucket (Atlan connection settings)_\n   - _You are using a private repository for Argo workflows (Argo Private repository settings)_\n   - _You want to customize the Kubernetes pod's metadata (Kubernetes Pod Annotation settings)_\n   - _You need specific S3 storage configuration (S3 storage settings)_\n\n## Install using Helm chart [‚Äã](https://docs.atlan.com/secure-agent/how-tos/aws-eks/install-secure-agent-on-aws-eks\\#install-using-helm-chart \"Direct link to Install using Helm chart\")\n\nFollow these steps to install the Secure Agent and its dependencies into your AWS EKS cluster using Helm charts.\n\n1. Install the Argo Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) required by the Secure Agent. This step installs only the CRDs. The Secure Agent is installed in the subsequent step using a Helm upgrade.\n\n\n\n\n\n```codeBlockLines_e6Vv\nhelm install <helm-app-name> oci://registry-1.docker.io/atlanhq/workflow-offline-agent \\\n     --version 0.1.0 \\\n     -n <namespace> \\\n     --create-namespace -f <path/to/agent_config_values.yaml> \\\n     --set agent.name=\"<secure-agent-name>\" \\\n     --set agent.atlan.domain=\"<atlan-tenant-domain>\" \\\n     --set agent.atlan.token=\"<atlan-api-token>\" \\\n     --set argo-workflows.controller.workflowNamespaces={<namespace>} \\\n     --set IsUpgrade=false\n\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReplace the placeholders:\n   - `<namespace>`: The Kubernetes namespace where you want to deploy the Secure Agent.\n   - `<path/to/agent_config_values.yaml>`: The path to the YAML config file.\n   - `<secure-agent-name>`: Unique name, like agent-us-east-cdw.\n   - `<helm-app-name>`: Unique Helm release name, like atlan-agent-v1.\n   - `<atlan-tenant-domain>`: Your Atlan domain, e.g., mycompany.atlan.com.\n   - `<atlan-api-token>`: Token used for authentication. See [Create a bearer token](https://docs.atlan.com/get-started/references/api-authentication).\n2. Use the following kubectl command to associate the IAM role with the service account. This enables the Secure Agent to access the S3 bucket securely using IAM Roles for Service Accounts (IRSA). Make sure the IAM role‚Äôs trust policy enables the argo-workflow service account to assume the role.\n\n\n\n\n\n```codeBlockLines_e6Vv\nkubectl annotate serviceaccount argo-workflow \\\n     -n  \\\n     eks.amazonaws.com/role-arn=arn:aws:iam:::role/\n\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReplace the placeholders:\n   - `<namespace`: The Kubernetes namespace where you want to deploy the Secure Agent.\n   - `<AWS_ACCOUNT_ID>`: Your AWS Account ID.\n   - `<YourAgentIAMRoleName>`: The IAM role name you created for the Secure Agent using IRSA.\n3. Install the Secure Agent by upgrading the Helm release. This step performs the actual Secure Agent installation after CRDs are in place.\n\n\n\n\n\n```codeBlockLines_e6Vv\nhelm upgrade <helm-app-name> oci://registry-1.docker.io/atlanhq/workflow-offline-agent \\\n     --version 0.1.0 \\\n     -n <namespace> \\\n     --create-namespace -f <path/to/agent_config_values.yaml> \\\n     --set agent.name=\"<secure-agent-name>\" \\\n     --set agent.atlan.domain=\"<atlan-tenant-domain>\" \\\n     --set agent.atlan.token=\"<atlan-api-token>\" \\\n     --set argo-workflows.controller.workflowNamespaces={<namespace>} \\\n     --set IsUpgrade=true\n\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReplace the placeholders:\n   - `<namespace>`: The Kubernetes namespace where you want to deploy the Secure Agent.\n   - `<path/to/agent_config_values.yaml>`: The path to the YAML config file.\n   - `<secure-agent-name>`: Unique name, like agent-us-east-cdw.\n   - `<helm-app-name>`: Unique Helm release name, like atlan-agent-v1.\n   - `<atlan-tenant-domain>`: Your Atlan domain, e.g., mycompany.atlan.com.\n   - `<atlan-api-token>`: Token used for authentication. See [Create a bearer token](https://docs.atlan.com/get-started/references/api-authentication).\n4. While the installation is in progress, you can run the following command to verify the progress:\n\n\n\n\n\n```codeBlockLines_e6Vv\nkubectl get pods -n <namespace>\n\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReplace `<namespace>` with the Kubernetes namespace used for deployment.\n\n\n## Verify installation [‚Äã](https://docs.atlan.com/secure-agent/how-tos/aws-eks/install-secure-agent-on-aws-eks\\#verify-installation \"Direct link to Verify installation\")\n\nTo confirm successful installation:\n\n1. Sign in to your Atlan tenant as an admin. For example, `https://<tenant>.atlan.com`.\n2. Navigate to the **Agent** tab.\n3. Search for your Secure Agent name.\n4. If the agent appears in the list and is marked **Active**, installation is complete.\n\n- [System requirements](https://docs.atlan.com/secure-agent/how-tos/aws-eks/install-secure-agent-on-aws-eks#system-requirements)\n- [Permissions required](https://docs.atlan.com/secure-agent/how-tos/aws-eks/install-secure-agent-on-aws-eks#permissions-required)\n- [Prerequisites](https://docs.atlan.com/secure-agent/how-tos/aws-eks/install-secure-agent-on-aws-eks#prerequisites)\n- [Install using Helm chart](https://docs.atlan.com/secure-agent/how-tos/aws-eks/install-secure-agent-on-aws-eks#install-using-helm-chart)\n- [Verify installation](https://docs.atlan.com/secure-agent/how-tos/aws-eks/install-secure-agent-on-aws-eks#verify-installation)\n\n‚úï\n\nHi there, I'm Ask AI.

Log in as a root user.\n\n2. Create the required directory to configure cgroup delegation with:\n\n\n\n\n\n```codeBlockLines_e6Vv\nsudo mkdir -p /etc/systemd/system/user@.service.d\n\n```\n\n3. Use the below `cat` command to create the delegation file with required configuration:\n\n\n\n\n\n```codeBlockLines_e6Vv\ncat <<EOF | sudo tee /etc/systemd/system/user@.service.d/delegate.conf\n[Service]\nDelegate=cpu cpuset io memory pids\nEOF\n\n```\n\n4. Use the below command to reload systemd:\n\n\n\n\n\n```codeBlockLines_e6Vv\nsudo systemctl daemon-reload && sudo reboot\n\n```\n\n5. To keep the Secure Agent running after logout, the root user must enable service persistence for the user installing it by running the following command:\n\n\n\n\n\n```codeBlockLines_e6Vv\nsudo loginctl enable-linger ``<user_installing_secure_agent>``\n\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   - Replace `<user_installing_secure_agent>` with the actual username of the user installing the Secure Agent.\n6. Run the following commands to enable IP forwarding so Secure Agent can communicate with other Secure Agent instances and make network requests to the Atlan tenant.\n   - IPv4 forwarding:\n\n\n\n\n\n     ```codeBlockLines_e6Vv\n     sudo sysctl -w net.ipv4.ip_forward=1\n\n     ```\n\n   - IPv6 forwarding:\n\n\n\n\n\n     ```codeBlockLines_e6Vv\n     sudo sysctl -w net.ipv6.conf.all.forwarding=1\n\n     ```\n7. To manage containerized workloads, install fuse-overlayfs with:\n\n\n\n\n\n```codeBlockLines_e6Vv\nsudo yum install fuse-overlayfs\n\n```\n\n8. The VM must have access to the source system‚Äôs secret manager to retrieve secrets. For more information, see how to provide access for some popular secret managers listed below:\n   - **AWS:** [Configure access for AWS Secrets Manager.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/auth-and-access_iam-policies.html)\n   - **Azure:** [Configure access for Azure Key Vault.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/frontdoor/managed-identity)\n   - **GCP:** [Configure access for GCP Secret Manager.](https://cloud.google.com/secret-manager/docs/access-control)\n\n## Permissions required [‚Äã](https://docs.atlan.com/secure-agent/how-tos/k3s/install-secure-agent-on-virtual-machine-k3s\\#permissions-required \"Direct link to Permissions required\")\n\nBefore installing the Secure Agent, the user must have the following permissions:\n\n- Create and modify directories in the user‚Äôs home directory: `~/.config/systemd/user`, `~/bin`, `~/.local/bin`, and `~/.rancher`.\n- Create and write log files.\n- Execute standard Linux commands: `mkdir`, `chmod`, `tar`, and `sed`.\n\n## Download Agent packages [‚Äã](https://docs.atlan.com/secure-agent/how-tos/k3s/install-secure-agent-on-virtual-machine-k3s\\#download-agent-packages \"Direct link to Download Agent packages\")\n\nFollow these steps to download the necessary packages for setting up the Secure Agent.\n\n**Did you know?**\n\nThe steps require Internet access to download files. In case the VM has no Internet connectivity, one can download them separately and copy the files to the VM.\n\n- Create a folder for deployment and navigate to it:\n\n\n\n\n\n```codeBlockLines_e6Vv\nmkdir -p atlan-secure-agent && cd atlan-secure-agent\n\n```\n\n- Run the following commands to download the required packages:\n  - Download the _Kubernetes install package_, which contains files to run K3s on an air-gapped VM:\n\n\n\n\n\n    ```codeBlockLines_e6Vv\n    curl -O https://atlan-public.s3.amazonaws.com/workflow-offline-agent/container/k3s_offline_package_main.tar\n\n    ```\n\n  - Download the _Container images package_ if an image registry isn't available:\n\n\n\n\n\n    ```codeBlockLines_e6Vv\n    curl -O https://atlan-public.s3.amazonaws.com/workflow-offline-agent/container/atlan_images_main.tar\n\n    ```\n\n  - Download the _Secure Agent install package_, which contains files for running the Secure Agent:\n\n\n\n\n\n    ```codeBlockLines_e6Vv\n    curl -O https://atlan-public.s3.amazonaws.com/workflow-offline-agent/container/atlan_install_config_main.tar.gz\n\n    ```\n- Verify that all the files are downloaded.\n\n\n## Install Secure Agent [‚Äã](https://docs.atlan.com/secure-agent/how-tos/k3s/install-secure-agent-on-virtual-machine-k3s\\#install-secure-agent \"Direct link to Install Secure Agent\")\n\nFollow these steps to install and configure the Secure Agent on the virtual machine.\n\n**Did you know?**\n\nThe installation can be performed by both root (administrative) and non-root (standard) users.\n\n- Navigate to the deployment folder (if not already):\n\n\n\n\n\n```codeBlockLines_e6Vv\ncd atlan-secure-agent\n\n```\n\n- Run the following command to extract the Secure Agent install package:\n\n\n\n\n\n```codeBlockLines_e6Vv\ntar -xvf atlan_install_config_main.tar.gz\n\n```\n\n- The `rootless-install` folder is extracted from the Secure Agent install package. Run the following command to create an environment file using the `env.sample` file located in the `rootless-install` folder:\n\n\n\n\n\n```codeBlockLines_e6Vv\ncp ./rootless-install/.env.sample .env\n\n```\n\n- Open the `.env` file and update these variables:\n\n\n\n\n\n```codeBlockLines_e6Vv\nVAR_ATLAN_SECURE_AGENT_NAME=prod-atlan-agent-vm\nVAR_ATLAN_DOMAIN=tenant.atlan.com\nVAR_ATLAN_TOKEN=<atlan-api-token>\nVAR_ATLAN_DATA_PATH=</absolute/path/to/atlan-secure-agent>\n\n```\n\n- Replace the environment variable values:\n  - `VAR_ATLAN_SECURE_AGENT_NAME:` Specify a meaningful and unique name for the Secure Agent. For example, `prod-atlan-agent-vm`.\n  - `VAR_ATLAN_DOMAIN:` Enter your Atlan tenant domain. For example, `tenant.atlan.com`.\n  - `VAR_ATLAN_TOKEN:` Provide the API key (Bearer token). For more information on generating an API key, see _Create a bearer token_.\n  - `VAR_ATLAN_DATA_PATH:` Specify the path where the `atlan-secure-agent` directory is located.\n- Run the following command to grant execution permission for the setup script:\n\n\n\n\n\n```codeBlockLines_e6Vv\nchmod +x rootless-install/setup.sh\n\n```\n\n- The extracted `setup.sh` file installs the Secure Agent and K3s.

It acts as a gateway between the single-tenant Atlan SaaS and external systems like Snowflake, Tableau, and other data sources. This document explains the Secure Agent's deployment architecture, key components, communication flows, and security considerations.\n\n## High-level architecture [‚Äã](https://docs.atlan.com/secure-agent/references/deployment-architecture\\#high-level-architecture \"Direct link to High-level architecture\")\n\nThis section describes how the Secure Agent is structured and deployed. It explains the core components that enable metadata extraction, job execution, and communication with Atlan.\n\n![Secure agent acts as a gateway](https://docs.atlan.com/assets/images/secure-agent-deployment-architecture-5ef4e73785b84cf123d09f9f8e539e6e.png)\n\n**Figure 1:** Atlan Secure Agent deployment architecture.\n\n## Core components [‚Äã](https://docs.atlan.com/secure-agent/references/deployment-architecture\\#core-components \"Direct link to Core components\")\n\nThe Secure Agent runs as a Kubernetes-based application within a customer's private cloud or on-premises environment. It consists of several key components that work together to execute metadata extraction tasks.\n\n### Argo Workflows [‚Äã](https://docs.atlan.com/secure-agent/references/deployment-architecture\\#argo-workflows \"Direct link to Argo Workflows\")\n\n- An Argo Workflow server is deployed to coordinate all activities and launch Kubernetes workloads.\n- The Secure Agent uses Argo Workflows to orchestrate and manage metadata extraction jobs.\n- Each workflow represents a unit of work, such as extracting metadata from a source system.\n\n### Agent orchestrator [‚Äã](https://docs.atlan.com/secure-agent/references/deployment-architecture\\#agent-orchestrator \"Direct link to Agent orchestrator\")\n\n- A scheduled job that runs every five minutes to check for jobs that need to be executed.\n- It connects to the Atlan tenant, retrieves job details, and initiates workflows accordingly.\n\n### Auxiliary services [‚Äã](https://docs.atlan.com/secure-agent/references/deployment-architecture\\#auxiliary-services \"Direct link to Auxiliary services\")\n\nAdditional services that support agent operations:\n\n- **Health monitoring service** sends periodic heartbeats to Atlan to confirm the agent is active.\n- **Logging service** uploads execution logs to Atlan for monitoring and debugging.\n\n### Metadata extraction workflows [‚Äã](https://docs.atlan.com/secure-agent/references/deployment-architecture\\#metadata-extraction-workflows \"Direct link to Metadata extraction workflows\")\n\n- Connector-specific jobs that extract metadata from source systems.\n- Workflows run in isolated containers, ensuring security and reliability.\n\n## Data flow [‚Äã](https://docs.atlan.com/secure-agent/references/deployment-architecture\\#data-flow \"Direct link to Data flow\")\n\nThe Secure Agent supports two modes of metadata transfer. Each mode determines how extracted metadata is delivered to Atlan.\n\n### Bucket relay [‚Äã](https://docs.atlan.com/secure-agent/references/deployment-architecture\\#bucket-relay \"Direct link to Bucket relay\")\n\nBucket relay is the recommended mode for metadata extraction. In this mode, metadata is first stored in enterprise-managed cloud storage before Atlan retrieves it.\n\n![Secure agent acts as a gateway](https://docs.atlan.com/assets/images/data-flow-bucket-relay-mode-405a8a7ee3c187bad2b6bdcc6d251018.png)\n\n**Figure 2:** Data flow in bucket relay mode.\n\n- The Secure Agent extracts metadata and writes it to a storage bucket in the customer‚Äôs cloud environment (such as AWS S3, Azure Blob Storage, or Google Cloud Storage). This is managed by providing the agent write access to cloud storage.\n- Atlan retrieves metadata from the storage bucket and processes it further. This is managed by providing Atlan read access to list and read files in cloud storage.\n- This mode ensures the extracted data remains within the customer‚Äôs infrastructure until Atlan explicitly fetches it. Customers can also use this data for auditing.\n\n### Direct ingestion [‚Äã](https://docs.atlan.com/secure-agent/references/deployment-architecture\\#direct-ingestion \"Direct link to Direct ingestion\")\n\nIn direct ingestion mode, metadata is transferred directly from the Secure Agent to Atlan.\n\n![Secure agent acts as a gateway](https://docs.atlan.com/assets/images/data-flow-direct-ingestion-mode-700b42f0aae8167513e9ab70dfba9182.png)\n\n**Figure 3:** Data flow in direct ingestion mode.\n\n- The Secure Agent uses pre-signed URLs to upload metadata directly to Atlan. Some cloud storage providers that use pre-signed URLs include:\n\n- [AWS reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/ShareObjectPreSignedURL.html)\n\n- [Azure reference](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-sas-overview)\n\n- [GCP reference](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/access-control/signed-urls)\n\n- A pre-signed URL grants temporary access to upload files without exposing long-term credentials.\n\n- Each URL has an expiration time, ensuring access is only available for a limited duration.\n\n\n## See also [‚Äã](https://docs.atlan.com/secure-agent/references/deployment-architecture\\#see-also \"Direct link to See also\")\n\n- [**Secure Agent - Security**](https://docs.atlan.com/secure-agent/references/security): Details on security mechanisms.\n\n- [High-level architecture](https://docs.atlan.com/secure-agent/references/deployment-architecture#high-level-architecture)\n- [Core components](https://docs.atlan.com/secure-agent/references/deployment-architecture#core-components)\n- [Data flow](https://docs.atlan.com/secure-agent/references/deployment-architecture#data-flow)\n- [See also](https://docs.atlan.com/secure-agent/references/deployment-architecture#see-also)\n\n‚úï\n\nHi there, I'm Ask AI.

    "markdown": "[Skip to main content](https://docs.atlan.com/secure-agent/references/security#__docusaurus_skipToContent_fallback)\n\nOn this page\n\nThe Secure Agent is designed with multiple security controls to protect metadata, credentials, and communication between systems. This document outlines its security mechanisms across authentication, encryption, container security, network security, and logging and monitoring.\n\n## Authentication and authorization [‚Äã](https://docs.atlan.com/secure-agent/references/security\\#authentication-and-authorization \"Direct link to Authentication and authorization\")\n\nThe Secure Agent implements security measures for authentication, encryption, and access control. This section details authentication mechanisms, including API key management and secret handling.\n\n### API key management [‚Äã](https://docs.atlan.com/secure-agent/references/security\\#api-key-management \"Direct link to API key management\")\n\nThe Secure Agent uses API keys for authentication when communicating with Atlan. These keys verify the agent‚Äôs identity and define its access scope.\n\n- **Authentication:** API keys authenticate the Secure Agent, allowing it to interact securely with Atlan. Each key is associated with a specific tenant and grants access based on permissions.\n- **Storage:** API keys are stored in enterprise-managed vaults, such as AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault, or Kubernetes Secrets. The Secure Agent retrieves the key dynamically during operation, eliminating manual configuration.\n- **Expiration:** API keys can have an expiration period, such as 90-180 days, or be configured based on internal security policies.\n- **Rotation:** When an API key nears expiration, a new key can be generated and stored in the secret vault. The Secure Agent automatically fetches the latest key from the vault.\n- **Revocation:** If an API key is compromised, it can be revoked. Once revoked, the Secure Agent retrieves a newly assigned key from the vault without requiring manual intervention.\n\n### Secret management [‚Äã](https://docs.atlan.com/secure-agent/references/security\\#secret-management \"Direct link to Secret management\")\n\nThe Secure Agent retrieves credentials securely without storing them locally.\n\n- **Enterprise-managed vaults:** The Secure Agent integrates with AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault, and other vaults to securely store credentials, keeping them within the organization‚Äôs security perimeter.\n- **Just-in-time access:** Credentials, such as database secrets, are retrieved dynamically from enterprise vaults when needed and are never stored locally.\n- **No credential transmission:** Secrets are never transmitted to or stored on Atlan, ensuring complete isolation of sensitive information.\n\n## Data security and encryption [‚Äã](https://docs.atlan.com/secure-agent/references/security\\#data-security-and-encryption \"Direct link to Data security and encryption\")\n\nThe Secure Agent protects metadata using encryption and strict access controls.\n\n- **Compliance with security standards:** The Secure Agent aligns with ISO 27001 and SOC 2 security standards, ensuring strong encryption, data protection, and access control measures.\n- **Data in transit:** All communication between the Secure Agent and Atlan is encrypted using TLS 1.2 over HTTPS. For network-level protections, see [Network security](https://docs.atlan.com/secure-agent/references/security#network-security).\n- **Data at rest:** Metadata stored in customer-managed storage or Atlan‚Äôs tenant bucket is encrypted using AES-256.\n- **Data minimization:** Only essential metadata is extracted and transmitted. Customers can configure data filters to exclude specific metadata fields from processing.\n- **Retention control:** Atlan doesn't require metadata post-ingestion, and customers can delete metadata from their storage buckets based on internal security policies.\n\n## Container security [‚Äã](https://docs.atlan.com/secure-agent/references/security\\#container-security \"Direct link to Container security\")\n\nThe Secure Agent implements security measures to protect container images, ensuring their integrity and mitigating security risks.\n\n- **Container image hosting:** Secure Agent container images are hosted on public repositories, such as Docker Hub and Amazon ECR. Organizations can deploy the Secure Agent from a private container registry to meet their compliance and security requirements.\n- **Vulnerability scanning:** Trivy scans container images for known vulnerabilities, outdated dependencies, misconfigurations, and exposed secrets. Scans are conducted weekly and whenever new changes are checked in.\n- **Image signing and verification:** Cosign signs container images to ensure authenticity. Image verification includes:\n  - Validating the image signature against Sigstore's transparency log.\n  - Verifying the signer‚Äôs identity through GitHub workflows.\n  - Confirming the certificate issued by GitHub‚Äôs OpenID Connect (OIDC) provider.\n- **License compliance:** Trivy scans for software license compliance to ensure proper licensing for all components within the container images.\n\n## Network security [‚Äã](https://docs.atlan.com/secure-agent/references/security\\#network-security \"Direct link to Network security\")\n\nThe Secure Agent operates within a controlled network environment to facilitate secure metadata extraction and communication with Atlan.\n\n### SSL certificates [‚Äã](https://docs.atlan.com/secure-agent/references/security\\#ssl-certificates \"Direct link to SSL certificates\")\n\nThe Secure Agent encrypts communications with Atlan, source systems, proxy servers, and secret managers.\n\n- **Encryption in transit:** All data communication between the Secure Agent and Atlan is encrypted using TLS 1.2 over HTTPS.\n- **Certificate management:**\n  - If trusted or well-known certificate authorities are used, no additional configuration is needed. The Default Trusted Certificate Authorities store contains certificates from the most common and trusted CAs, which the Secure Agent uses to secure connections.\n  - If internal or private certificate authorities are used, the Secure Agent trusts these custom certificate authorities through the infrastructure‚Äôs default certificate store.\n\n### Whitelisting [‚Äã](https://docs.atlan.com/secure-agent/references/security\\#whitelisting \"Direct link to Whitelisting\")\n\nConfiguring network access ensures only trusted communication between the Secure Agent and Atlan.\n\n- **Domain whitelisting:** The Secure Agent requires outbound access to Atlan through the domain `tenant.atlan.com`. Domain-based whitelisting simplifies network configurations while maintaining security.\n- **DNS resolution:** The Secure Agent relies on standard DNS resolution to reach Atlan domains. Network configurations must allow name resolution for `tenant.atlan.com`.\n- **IP-based whitelisting:** If domain-based whitelisting isn‚Äôt feasible and specific IP ranges must be allowed, refer to the [list of required IP ranges](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/ips/) to be whitelisted. If you need further assistance, contact [Atlan Support](https://docs.atlan.com/support/submit-request).\n\n## Logging and monitoring [‚Äã](https://docs.atlan.com/secure-agent/references/security\\#logging-and-monitoring \"Direct link to Logging and monitoring\")\n\nThe Secure Agent captures logs for workflow execution, system orchestration, and Kubernetes operations while also providing monitoring capabilities.\n\n### Types of logs [‚Äã](https://docs.atlan.com/secure-agent/references/security\\#types-of-logs \"Direct link to Types of logs\")\n\n- **Workflow logs:** Capture job execution details, including start and completion status, connections to source systems and secret managers, metadata extraction results, and authentication status. These logs are sent to Atlan and accessible from the workflow status page.\n- **Orchestration logs:** Track the Secure Agent‚Äôs scheduled operations, including connection attempts to Atlan, retrieval of workflow requests, and workflow submission to the Argo engine. Logs also include error messages and performance metrics.\n- **Argo logs:** Provide visibility into workflow execution, including job scheduling, resource allocation, state transitions, and error handling.\n- **Kubernetes logs:** Capture system-level events, such as pod lifecycle changes, container startup and shutdown, resource allocation, network connectivity, and health checks.\n\n### Monitoring [‚Äã](https://docs.atlan.com/secure-agent/references/security\\#monitoring \"Direct link to Monitoring\")\n\n- **Health checks:** Secure Agent components run periodic health checks to verify connectivity, resource availability, and system integrity.\n- **Resource utilization:** CPU, memory, and storage usage are monitored to track system load and detect potential bottlenecks.\n\nLogs can be viewed in Atlan or integrated with external monitoring systems.\n\n- [Authentication and authorization](https://docs.atlan.com/secure-agent/references/security#authentication-and-authorization)\n- [Data security and encryption](https://docs.atlan.com/secure-agent/references/security#data-security-and-encryption)\n- [Container security](https://docs.atlan.com/secure-agent/references/security#container-security)\n- [Network security](https://docs.atlan.com/secure-agent/references/security#network-security)\n- [Logging and monitoring](https://docs.atlan.com/secure-agent/references/security#logging-and-monitoring)\n\n‚úï\n\nHi there, I'm Ask AI.

Atlan handles this through [access control policies](https://docs.atlan.com/product/capabilities/governance/custom-metadata/how-tos/control-access-metadata-data#access-policies).\n\nBy default in Atlan, all users can see the existence of all assets. The _All assets_ view includes all assets in your Atlan data estate.\n\nTo change this default setting, see [Disable all assets view](https://docs.atlan.com/product/administration/labs/how-tos/restrict-asset-visibility#disable-all-assets-view).\n\nGenerally, you may want to limit specific teams from being able to see all assets in Atlan.\n\nAll you need to do is turn off the default behavior, so that your [member](https://docs.atlan.com/product/capabilities/governance/users-and-groups/concepts/what-are-user-roles#member) and [guest](https://docs.atlan.com/product/capabilities/governance/users-and-groups/concepts/what-are-user-roles#guest) users will only have access to the assets curated through their [personas](https://docs.atlan.com/product/capabilities/governance/access-control/concepts/what-are-personas) and [purposes](https://docs.atlan.com/product/capabilities/governance/access-control/concepts/what-are-purposes).

Atlan does **not** send any data to the AI service and only uses metadata for supported capabilities. For questions about data security, see below.\n\nLearn more about how [Atlan AI](https://docs.atlan.com/product/capabilities/atlan-ai/concepts/what-is-atlan-ai) processes and stores your data:\n\n#### What services does Atlan AI use? [‚Äã](https://docs.atlan.com/product/capabilities/atlan-ai/concepts/security\\#what-services-does-atlan-ai-use \"Direct link to What services does Atlan AI use?\")\n\nAtlan uses [Azure OpenAI Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/products/cognitive-services/openai-service) to power Atlan AI. Specifically, Atlan uses GPT-4o, a large, pretrained AI model.\n\n#### What data does Atlan send to the AI service? [‚Äã](https://docs.atlan.com/product/capabilities/atlan-ai/concepts/security\\#what-data-does-atlan-send-to-the-ai-service \"Direct link to What data does Atlan send to the AI service?\")\n\nAtlan does **not** send any data to the AI service. Atlan only sends metadata for supported capabilities.\n\nFor example:\n\n- [Atlan AI-suggested asset descriptions](https://docs.atlan.com/product/capabilities/atlan-ai/how-tos/use-atlan-ai-for-documentation) \\- table, view, column, database, or schema name.\n- [Atlan AI-suggested term descriptions](https://docs.atlan.com/product/capabilities/atlan-ai/how-tos/use-atlan-ai-for-documentation) \\- glossary name and description, category name and description, and term name.\n- [Atlan AI-suggested lineage explanations](https://docs.atlan.com/product/capabilities/atlan-ai/how-tos/use-atlan-ai-for-lineage-analysis) \\- SQL transformations in lineage with upstream and downstream asset names.\n- [Atlan AI-suggested aliases](https://docs.atlan.com/product/capabilities/discovery/how-tos/add-an-alias) \\- table, view, column, database, or schema name.\n- [Atlan AI-suggested READMEs for terms](https://docs.atlan.com/product/capabilities/atlan-ai/how-tos/use-atlan-ai-for-documentation) \\- glossary, category, and term name and description, and any existing READMEs within the same glossary.\n\n#### Does Atlan use any metadata or data to train Atlan AI? [‚Äã](https://docs.atlan.com/product/capabilities/atlan-ai/concepts/security\\#does-atlan-use-any-metadata-or-data-to-train-atlan-ai \"Direct link to Does Atlan use any metadata or data to train Atlan AI?\")\n\nNo, Atlan does **not** use your metadata or data for fine-tuning or training AI models.\n\n#### Is the data processed through Atlan AI encrypted? [‚Äã](https://docs.atlan.com/product/capabilities/atlan-ai/concepts/security\\#is-the-data-processed-through-atlan-ai-encrypted \"Direct link to Is the data processed through Atlan AI encrypted?\")\n\nAtlan makes HTTPS requests from your tenant, applicable to all [supported cloud platforms](https://docs.atlan.com/platform/references/atlan-architecture). The data is encrypted in transit using TLS 1.2, AWS PrivateLink, or Azure virtual network peering. Atlan uses 256-bit Advanced Encryption Standard (AES-256) algorithm to encrypt data at rest.\n\n#### How does Atlan ensure security development of Atlan AI? [‚Äã](https://docs.atlan.com/product/capabilities/atlan-ai/concepts/security\\#how-does-atlan-ensure-security-development-of-atlan-ai \"Direct link to How does Atlan ensure security development of Atlan AI?\")\n\nAtlan AI follows [OWASP Top 10](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten) that includes application security reviews and [Static Application Security Testing (SAST) tools](https://owasp.org/www-community/Source_Code_Analysis_Tools).\n\n#### Does Atlan AI comply with any governance or legal frameworks? [‚Äã](https://docs.atlan.com/product/capabilities/atlan-ai/concepts/security\\#does-atlan-ai-comply-with-any-governance-or-legal-frameworks \"Direct link to Does Atlan AI comply with any governance or legal frameworks?\")\n\nWhile Atlan is [HIPAA and GDPR compliant](https://security.atlan.com/), Atlan AI is currently not. As Atlan AI matures, compliance continues to be our key focus.\n\n#### Does Atlan AI process PII or other sensitive data? [‚Äã](https://docs.atlan.com/product/capabilities/atlan-ai/concepts/security\\#does-atlan-ai-process-pii-or-other-sensitive-data \"Direct link to Does Atlan AI process PII or other sensitive data?\")\n\nAtlan AI only processes user input and metadata, which typically do not contain PII or sensitive data. However, it is the organization's responsibility to ensure that PII or other sensitive data is not available in the metadata or shared via user input.\n\n#### What is the data retention policy for Atlan AI? [‚Äã](https://docs.atlan.com/product/capabilities/atlan-ai/concepts/security\\#what-is-the-data-retention-policy-for-atlan-ai \"Direct link to What is the data retention policy for Atlan AI?\")\n\nAtlan does **not** store any data for Atlan AI.\n\nThis is enforced in the following two ways:\n\n- Atlan has an [exemption from Microsoft](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/legal/cognitive-services/openai/data-privacy#how-can-customers-get-an-exemption-from-abuse-monitoring-and-human-review) to not store any data. Keeping data sensitivity in mind, Atlan has opted out of abuse monitoring and human review from Azure OpenAI Service.\n- Only the metadata generated using Atlan AI is cataloged in Atlan.\n\n#### How does Atlan manage security vulnerabilities for Atlan AI? [‚Äã](https://docs.atlan.com/product/capabilities/atlan-ai/concepts/security\\#how-does-atlan-manage-security-vulnerabilities-for-atlan-ai \"Direct link to How does Atlan manage security vulnerabilities for Atlan AI?\")\n\nVulnerabilities and incidents are managed in accordance with the [existing program and policy](https://docs.atlan.com/platform/concepts/high-availability-and-disaster-recovery-ha-dr).\n\n#### How does Atlan manage the performance and scale for Atlan AI? [‚Äã](https://docs.atlan.com/product/capabilities/atlan-ai/concepts/security\\#how-does-atlan-manage-the-performance-and-scale-for-atlan-ai \"Direct link to How does Atlan manage the performance and scale for Atlan AI?\")\n\nWe utilize the scalability of our existing cloud infrastructure while relying on [Azure OpenAI](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/solutions/ai/).\n\n‚úï\n\nHi there, I'm Ask AI.

It acts as a blueprint for organizations to design their business applications and processes. Data models can be of different types: relational, hierarchical, entity relationship, and network.\n\nAtlan enables you to ingest your entity‚Äìrelationship (ER) models and associate them with existing data assets in Atlan. Cataloging your ER model metadata in Atlan can help you:\n\n- Foster collaboration - business and technical users work best when they share a common understanding of the data landscape without tool boundaries.\n- Handle change management through impact analysis - data models enable visualization of an asset's lifecycle within an organization, helping users assess business impact due to technical changes with accuracy and vice versa.\n- Implement data governance - define access control mechanisms, data retention policies, and data governance rules spanning different systems by understanding relationships between data assets. When business-approved data models are coupled with technical objects, trust and accountability are established between key stakeholders.\n\n![Data models_Atlan.png](https://docs.atlan.com/assets/images/data-models-atlan-dd02b0157fb6e009490172ff611aa583.png)\n\n## Ingest ER models [‚Äã](https://docs.atlan.com/product/capabilities/data-models/concepts/what-are-data-models\\#ingest-er-models \"Direct link to Ingest ER models\")\n\nYou can ingest your ER models in Atlan using the following methods:\n\n- [Data model ingestion](https://solutions.atlan.com/data-model-ingestion) \\- Atlan recommends using this custom package to ingest your ER models via an Excel template.\n- [Atlan SDK](https://developer.atlan.com/models/model/)\n- [Atlan REST API](https://developer.atlan.com/snippets/advanced-examples/create/)\n\n## Entity‚Äìrelationship models [‚Äã](https://docs.atlan.com/product/capabilities/data-models/concepts/what-are-data-models\\#entityrelationship-models \"Direct link to Entity‚Äìrelationship models\")\n\nEntity‚Äìrelationship (ER) models focus on entities (objects/concepts) and the attributes (characteristics) and relationships (associations) between those entities.\n\nIn the context of entity‚Äìrelationship modeling, a model encompasses the entities, attributes, and relationships that define how data is organized and interactions between different elements within a specific domain.\n\nData models can be used to represent information at different levels of abstraction:\n\n- Conceptual - overall structure of content without specific details. This acts as a starting point for new data initiatives and is the most abstract form of the model.\n- Logical - implementation-agnostic breakdown of data into specific objects and interactions between these objects.\n- Physical - a refined adaptation of data concepts conforming to a particular software application or data storage system. This level takes into account finer nuances like naming conventions, optimizations, partitioning, and more.\n\n## Entity-relationship diagrams [‚Äã](https://docs.atlan.com/product/capabilities/data-models/concepts/what-are-data-models\\#entity-relationship-diagrams \"Direct link to Entity-relationship diagrams\")\n\nAn entity-relationship diagram (ERD) is a visual representation of data that illustrates the entities (objects or concepts) within a system, relationships between those entities, and their attributes.\n\n- **Entity** \\- in an ERD, an entity is a fundamental component that represents a real-world object or concept within a database. For example, entities are typically nouns, such as `Customer`, `Order`, or `Product` and data can be stored about them.\n- **Attribute** \\- an entity has attributes, which are the properties or characteristics of the entity. For example, a `Customer` entity may have attributes like `CustomerID`, `Name`, `Email`, and `Phone Number`.\n- **Relationship** \\- a relationship determines how two entities interact with each other. For example, a `Customer` places an `Order`. A relationship encompasses several elements, like:\n  - Cardinality - defines the quantitative aspect of a relationship. For example, a `Quote` provides pricing for many related `Orders` (one-to-many).\n  - Optionality - defines whether a relationship is mandatory in an entity. For example, an `Order` must have an associated `Customer`.\n  - Cardinality and optionality can be combined to define business rules. For example, in a `Library` system, a `Member` can borrow 0-n book(s).\n  - Types of relationships:\n    - Association - refers to a peer-to-peer relationship between two entities.\n    - Generalization - refers to a parent-child relationship between two entities. For example, a `Loan` entity can be of type `Home Loan`, `Auto Loan`, `Business Loan`, and so on.\n- **Model** \\- in the context of ER modeling, a model encompasses the entities, attributes, and relationships that define how data is organized and how different elements interact within a specific domain.\n  - Models can be of different types - conceptual, logical, and physical.\n\n  - Mapping - entities within a model can be mapped to entities within another model of a different type. For example, a logical entity `Order` can be mapped to your assets in Atlan, such as an `Order` table in Snowflake.\n\n- [Ingest ER models](https://docs.atlan.com/product/capabilities/data-models/concepts/what-are-data-models#ingest-er-models)\n- [Entity‚Äìrelationship models](https://docs.atlan.com/product/capabilities/data-models/concepts/what-are-data-models#entityrelationship-models)\n- [Entity-relationship diagrams](https://docs.atlan.com/product/capabilities/data-models/concepts/what-are-data-models#entity-relationship-diagrams)\n\n‚úï\n\nHi there, I'm Ask AI.

[‚Äã](https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/data-warehouses/snowflake/troubleshooting/troubleshooting-snowflake-tag-management\\#if-a-tag-is-deleted-in-snowflake-will-the-corresponding-tag-in-atlan-also-be-deleted \"Direct link to If a tag is deleted in Snowflake, will the corresponding tag in Atlan also be deleted?\")\n\nOnly the imported Snowflake tag associated with the corresponding Atlan tag and its association with linked assets will be removed. The Atlan tag and the Snowflake assets to which the Atlan tag is attached will remain unaffected.\n\n#### How will tag propagation work for Snowflake tags? [‚Äã](https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/data-warehouses/snowflake/troubleshooting/troubleshooting-snowflake-tag-management\\#how-will-tag-propagation-work-for-snowflake-tags \"Direct link to How will tag propagation work for Snowflake tags?\")\n\nAtlan supports [tag propagation](https://docs.atlan.com/faq/tags-and-metadata-management#why-does-tag-propagation-take-time-to-apply) based on asset hierarchy and lineage. This existing functionality will remain unaffected by imported Snowflake tags. To learn about tag propagation in Snowflake, see [here](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/object-tagging#tag-lineage).\n\n#### How can I find out if reverse tag sync was successful? [‚Äã](https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/data-warehouses/snowflake/troubleshooting/troubleshooting-snowflake-tag-management\\#how-can-i-find-out-if-reverse-tag-sync-was-successful \"Direct link to How can I find out if reverse tag sync was successful?\")\n\nIf you're using the [account usage method](https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/data-warehouses/snowflake/how-tos/set-up-snowflake#choose-metadata-fetching-method), expect latency of data for up to 3 hours. You can also use a [table function](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/functions/tag_references) like `TAG_REFERENCES` to confirm reverse tag sync.\n\n#### What happens if a tag is deleted in Atlan but remains in Snowflake? [‚Äã](https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/data-warehouses/snowflake/troubleshooting/troubleshooting-snowflake-tag-management\\#what-happens-if-a-tag-is-deleted-in-atlan-but-remains-in-snowflake \"Direct link to What happens if a tag is deleted in Atlan but remains in Snowflake?\")\n\nThe tag will be recreated during the next Snowflake crawler run and linked to assets where the relationship still exists in Snowflake.\n\n#### Does enabling reverse sync automatically push all updates to Snowflake? [‚Äã](https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/data-warehouses/snowflake/troubleshooting/troubleshooting-snowflake-tag-management\\#does-enabling-reverse-sync-automatically-push-all-updates-to-snowflake \"Direct link to Does enabling reverse sync automatically push all updates to Snowflake?\")\n\nNo. However, you can [set up playbooks](https://docs.atlan.com/product/capabilities/playbooks/how-tos/set-up-playbooks) in Atlan to update your Snowflake assets with imported tags at scale. If [reverse sync is enabled](https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/data-warehouses/snowflake/how-tos/manage-snowflake-tags#push-tag-updates-to-snowflake) for the Snowflake tags, updates will be pushed to Snowflake as well.\n\n#### What is the default propagation setting for synced Snowflake tags and can it be changed? [‚Äã](https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/data-warehouses/snowflake/troubleshooting/troubleshooting-snowflake-tag-management\\#what-is-the-default-propagation-setting-for-synced-snowflake-tags-and-can-it-be-changed \"Direct link to What is the default propagation setting for synced Snowflake tags and can it be changed?\")\n\nWhen imported Snowflake tags are attached to assets after a [crawler run](https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/data-warehouses/snowflake/how-tos/crawl-snowflake), [tag propagation is turned off](https://docs.atlan.com/faq/tags-and-metadata-management#why-does-tag-propagation-take-time-to-apply) by default in Atlan.\n\n#### Can I restrict who can push asset-specific tag syncs to Snowflake? [‚Äã](https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/data-warehouses/snowflake/troubleshooting/troubleshooting-snowflake-tag-management\\#can-i-restrict-who-can-push-asset-specific-tag-syncs-to-snowflake \"Direct link to Can I restrict who can push asset-specific tag syncs to Snowflake?\")\n\nNo, this functionality is currently unavailable. However, stay tuned for more updates.\n\n#### Will reverse sync remove a tag from an asset in Snowflake if it is removed in Atlan? [‚Äã](https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/data-warehouses/snowflake/troubleshooting/troubleshooting-snowflake-tag-management\\#will-reverse-sync-remove-a-tag-from-an-asset-in-snowflake-if-it-is-removed-in-atlan \"Direct link to Will reverse sync remove a tag from an asset in Snowflake if it is removed in Atlan?\")\n\nIf a tag is removed from a Snowflake asset in Atlan, it will not delete the tag in Snowflake. Instead, the asset will no longer be linked to the Snowflake tag in Atlan only.\n\n#### If tag propagation and reverse sync are enabled, will my assets in Snowflake display multiple values of the same tag? [‚Äã](https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/data-warehouses/snowflake/troubleshooting/troubleshooting-snowflake-tag-management\\#if-tag-propagation-and-reverse-sync-are-enabled-will-my-assets-in-snowflake-display-multiple-values-of-the-same-tag \"Direct link to If tag propagation and reverse sync are enabled, will my assets in Snowflake display multiple values of the same tag?\")\n\nIf both tag propagation and reverse sync are enabled, and multiple values of the same tag are being propagated via different paths to a Snowflake asset:\n\n- Atlan will preserve all values of the attached tag on the asset.\n- Snowflake will only preserve the last modified value of the attached tag on the asset.\n\n#### Is it possible to filter and select specific tags to import in Atlan? [‚Äã](https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/data-warehouses/snowflake/troubleshooting/troubleshooting-snowflake-tag-management\\#is-it-possible-to-filter-and-select-specific-tags-to-import-in-atlan \"Direct link to Is it possible to filter and select specific tags to import in Atlan?\")\n\nNo, Atlan currently does not support filtering and selecting specific Snowflake tags to import. Atlan will crawl all the tags associated with an asset in Snowflake.\n\n#### Can Atlan reverse sync tags to dropped tables in Snowflake? [‚Äã](https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/data-warehouses/snowflake/troubleshooting/troubleshooting-snowflake-tag-management\\#can-atlan-reverse-sync-tags-to-dropped-tables-in-snowflake \"Direct link to Can Atlan reverse sync tags to dropped tables in Snowflake?\")\n\nIf tables are dropped in Snowflake, then the corresponding link between the table and tag is also removed. If new tables are created in their place, you will need to recreate the link.\n\nYou can either:\n\n- Apply tags to the new tables in Snowflake\n- [Crawl the new Snowflake tables in Atlan](https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/data-warehouses/snowflake/how-tos/crawl-snowflake), [run a playbook for tag attachment](https://docs.atlan.com/product/capabilities/playbooks/how-tos/set-up-playbooks), and then [push tag updates to Snowflake](https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/data-warehouses/snowflake/how-tos/manage-snowflake-tags#push-tag-updates-to-snowflake)\n\nIf you're also using dbt, you can use pre-hooks and post-hooks to preserve metadata like attached tags while building your dbt models. Refer to [dbt documentation](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/hooks-operations#about-hooks) to learn more about hooks.\n\n‚úï\n\nHi there, I'm Ask AI. How can I help you?",

The miner will not mine any queries that ran before that time window. If the queries that created your assets ran before that time window, lineage for those assets will not be present.\n- To mine more than the previous two weeks of query history, either use [S3-based query mining](https://docs.atlan.com/product/connections/how-tos/mine-queries-through-s3) or [contact Atlan support](https://docs.atlan.com/support/submit-request). Note that Snowflake itself only retains query history for so long as well, though. Once Snowflake itself no longer contains the query history we will be unable to mine it for lineage.\n- Lineage is unsupported for parameterized queries. Snowflake currently [does not resolve values](https://community.snowflake.com/s/article/How-to-rebuild-parameterized-queries-from-bind-variables) for parameterized queries before logging them in query history. This limits Atlan from generating lineage in such cases.\n\n#### Missing attributes and lineage [‚Äã](https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/data-warehouses/snowflake/troubleshooting/troubleshooting-snowflake-connectivity\\#missing-attributes-and-lineage \"Direct link to Missing attributes and lineage\")\n\n- When using the account usage extraction method, there are currently some limitations. We are working with Snowflake to find workarounds for crawling the following:\n  - External table location data\n  - Procedures\n  - Primary key designation\n- Furthermore, only database-level filtering is currently possible.\n\n#### What views does Atlan require access to for the account usage method? [‚Äã](https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/data-warehouses/snowflake/troubleshooting/troubleshooting-snowflake-connectivity\\#what-views-does-atlan-require-access-to-for-the-account-usage-method \"Direct link to What views does Atlan require access to for the account usage method?\")\n\nWhen using the [account usage method](https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/data-warehouses/snowflake/how-tos/set-up-snowflake#grant-permissions-for-account-usage-method) for fetching metadata, Atlan requires access to the following views in Snowflake:\n\n- For the crawler: `DATABASES`, `SCHEMATA`, `TABLES`, `VIEWS`, `COLUMNS`, and `PIPES`\n- For the miner and [popularity metrics](https://docs.atlan.com/product/capabilities/usage-and-popularity/how-tos/interpret-usage-metrics): `QUERY_HISTORY`, `ACCESS_HISTORY`, and `SESSIONS`\n\n#### Why am I getting a destination URL mismatch error when authenticating via Okta SSO? [‚Äã](https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/data-warehouses/snowflake/troubleshooting/troubleshooting-snowflake-connectivity\\#why-am-i-getting-a-destination-url-mismatch-error-when-authenticating-via-okta-sso \"Direct link to Why am I getting a destination URL mismatch error when authenticating via Okta SSO?\")\n\nThis error can occur when you're connecting to Snowflake through [Okta SSO](https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/data-warehouses/snowflake/how-tos/set-up-snowflake) and enter the URL of your Snowflake instance in a format different from the one used in Okta.\n\nSnowflake follows two URL formats:\n\n- Legacy format - ¬†`<AccountLocator>.<Region>.snowflakecomputing.com` or `<AccountLocator>.<Region>.<cloud>.snowflakecomputing.com`\n- New URL format - `<Orgname>-<AccountName>.snowflakecomputing.com`\n\nEnsure that you're using the same Snowflake URL format in Snowflake and Okta. Refer to [Snowflake documentation](https://community.snowflake.com/s/article/Destination-URL-mismatch-when-using-Native-OKTA-SSO) to learn more.\n\n#### Why am I getting a 'name or service not known' error when connecting via private link? [‚Äã](https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/data-warehouses/snowflake/troubleshooting/troubleshooting-snowflake-connectivity\\#why-am-i-getting-a-name-or-service-not-known-error-when-connecting-via-private-link \"Direct link to Why am I getting a 'name or service not known' error when connecting via private link?\")\n\nIf you're getting the following error messages - `java.net.UnknownHostException` and `Name or service not known` \\- this is a known error for users who have upgraded to the Snowflake JDBC driver version 3.13.25., have underscores in their account name, and connect to their Snowflake accounts over [private link](https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/data-warehouses/snowflake/how-tos/set-up-an-aws-private-network-link-to-snowflake) (for example, `https://my_account.us-west-2.privatelink.snowflakecomputing.com`).\n\nIf your Snowflake account name has an underscore - for example, `my_account` \\- ¬†the updated JDBC driver will automatically convert underscores to dashes or hyphens `-`. This does not affect normal URLs because Snowflake accepts URLs with both hyphens and underscores.\n\nFor private link users, however, the JDBC driver will return an error if there are underscores present in the account name and the connection will fail. To troubleshoot further, refer to [Snowflake documentation](https://community.snowflake.com/s/article/Behaviour-Change-Release-information-associated-with-Snowflake-JDBC-driver-version-3-13-25).\n\n‚úï\n\nHi there, I'm Ask AI.

In the top right of any screen, navigate to¬†**New** and then click¬†**New Workflow**.\n2. From the filters along the top, click **Miner**.\n3. From the list of packages, select **Snowflake Miner** and then click **Setup Workflow**.\n\n## Configure the miner [‚Äã](https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/data-warehouses/snowflake/how-tos/mine-snowflake\\#configure-the-miner \"Direct link to Configure the miner\")\n\nTo configure the Snowflake miner:\n\n1. For _Connection_, select the connection to mine. (To select a connection, [the crawler](https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/data-warehouses/snowflake/how-tos/crawl-snowflake) must have already run.)\n\n2. For _Miner Extraction Method_, select **Source**, **Agent**, or see the separate instructions for the [S3 miner](https://docs.atlan.com/product/connections/how-tos/mine-queries-through-s3).\n\n3. For _Snowflake Database_:\n   - If the connection is configured with [access to the snowflake database](https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/data-warehouses/snowflake/how-tos/set-up-snowflake), choose **Default**.\n   - If the connection can only [access a separate cloned database](https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/data-warehouses/snowflake/how-tos/set-up-snowflake), choose **Cloned Database**.\n4. If you are using a cloned database, enter the name of the cloned database in _Database Name_ and the name of the cloned schema in _Schema Name_.\n\n5. For _Start time_, choose the earliest date from which to mine query history.\n\n\n\ninfo\n\n\n\n\n\nüí™ **Did you know?** The miner restricts you to only querying the past two weeks of query history. If you need to query more history, for example in an initial load, consider using the [S3 miner](https://docs.atlan.com/product/connections/how-tos/mine-queries-through-s3) first. After the initial load, you can [modify the miner's configuration](https://docs.atlan.com/product/connections/how-tos/manage-connectivity) to use query history extraction.\n\n6. To check for any permissions or other configuration issues before running the miner, click **Preflight checks**.\n\n7. At the bottom of the screen, click **Next** to proceed.\n\n\n### Agent extraction method [‚Äã](https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/data-warehouses/snowflake/how-tos/mine-snowflake\\#agent-extraction-method \"Direct link to Agent extraction method\")\n\nAtlan supports using a Secure Agent for mining query history from Snowflake. To use a Secure Agent, follow these steps:\n\n1. Select the **Agent** tab.\n2. Configure the Snowflake data source by adding the secret keys for your secret store. For details on the required fields, refer to the connection configuration used when [crawling Snowflake](https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/data-warehouses/snowflake/how-tos/crawl-snowflake).\n3. Complete the Secure Agent configuration by following the instructions in the [How to configure Secure Agent for workflow execution](https://docs.atlan.com/secure-agent/how-tos/configure-secure-agent-for-workflow-execution) guide.\n4. Click **Next** after completing the configuration.\n\ndanger\n\nIf running the miner for the first time, Atlan recommends setting a start date around three days prior to the current date and then scheduling it daily to build up to two weeks of query history. Mining two weeks of query history on the first miner run may cause delays. For all subsequent runs, Atlan requires a minimum lag of 24 to 48 hours to capture all the relevant transformations that were part of a session. Learn more about the miner logic [here](https://docs.atlan.com/product/capabilities/lineage/troubleshooting/troubleshooting-lineage#miner-logic).\n\n## Configure the miner behavior [‚Äã](https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/data-warehouses/snowflake/how-tos/mine-snowflake\\#configure-the-miner-behavior \"Direct link to Configure the miner behavior\")\n\nTo configure the Snowflake miner behavior:\n\n1. (Optional) For _Calculate popularity_, keep **True** to retrieve [usage and popularity metrics](https://docs.atlan.com/product/capabilities/usage-and-popularity/how-tos/interpret-usage-metrics) for your Snowflake assets from query history.\n   - For _Excluded Users_, type the names of users to be excluded while calculating [usage metrics](https://docs.atlan.com/product/capabilities/usage-and-popularity/how-tos/interpret-usage-metrics) for Snowflake assets. Press `Enter` after each name to add more names.\n2. (Optional) For _Advanced Config_, keep _Default_ for the default configuration or click **Custom** to configure the miner:\n   - If Atlan support has provided you with a custom control configuration,¬†enter the configuration into the¬†_Custom Config_ box.\n   - You can also enter `{‚Äúignore-all-case‚Äù: true}` to enable crawling assets with case-sensitive identifiers.\n   - For _Popularity Window (days)_, 90 days is the maximum limit. You can set a shorter popularity window of less than 90 days.\n\n## Run the miner [‚Äã](https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/data-warehouses/snowflake/how-tos/mine-snowflake\\#run-the-miner \"Direct link to Run the miner\")\n\nTo run the Snowflake miner, after completing the steps above:\n\n- To run the miner once immediately, at the bottom of the screen, click the **Run** button.\n- To schedule the miner to run hourly, daily, weekly, or monthly, at the bottom of the screen, click the **Schedule & Run** button.\n\nOnce the miner has completed running, you will see lineage for Snowflake assets that were created in Snowflake between the start time and when the miner ran! üéâ\n\n- [Select the miner](https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/data-warehouses/snowflake/how-tos/mine-snowflake#select-the-miner)\n- [Configure the miner](https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/data-warehouses/snowflake/how-tos/mine-snowflake#configure-the-miner)\n- [Configure the miner behavior](https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/data-warehouses/snowflake/how-tos/mine-snowflake#configure-the-miner-behavior)\n- [Run the miner](https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/data-warehouses/snowflake/how-tos/mine-snowflake#run-the-miner)",

Please [raise a support request](https://docs.atlan.com/support/submit-request) to do so.\n\n(For all details, see the [Snowflake documentation](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/privatelink-azure).)\n\n## Fetch Private Link information [‚Äã](https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/data-warehouses/snowflake/how-tos/set-up-an-azure-private-network-link-to-snowflake\\#fetch-private-link-information \"Direct link to Fetch Private Link information\")\n\nLog in to snowCLI using the `ACCOUNTADMIN` account, and run the following commands:\n\n```codeBlockLines_e6Vv\nuse role accountadmin;\nselect system$get_privatelink_config();\n\n```\n\nThis will produce an output like the following (formatted here for readability):\n\n```codeBlockLines_e6Vv\n{\n   \"regionless-snowsight-privatelink-url\": \"abc123.privatelink.snowflakecomputing.com\",\n   \"privatelink-account-name\": \"abc123.west-europe.privatelink\",\n   \"snowsight-privatelink-url\": \"abc123.west-europe.privatelink.snowflakecomputing.com\",\n   \"privatelink-account-url\": \"abc123.west-europe.privatelink.snowflakecomputing.com\",\n   \"privatelink-connection-ocsp-urls\": \"[]\",\n   \"privatelink-pls-id\": \"abc123.westeurope.azure.privatelinkservice\",\n   \"regionless-privatelink-account-url\": \"abc123.privatelink.snowflakecomputing.com\",\n   \"privatelink_ocsp-url\": \"ocsp.abc123.west-europe.privatelink.snowflakecomputing.com\",\n   \"privatelink-connection-urls\": \"[]\"\n}\n\n```\n\n## Share details with Atlan support team [‚Äã](https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/data-warehouses/snowflake/how-tos/set-up-an-azure-private-network-link-to-snowflake\\#share-details-with-atlan-support-team \"Direct link to Share details with Atlan support team\")\n\nShare the following values with the [Atlan support team](https://docs.atlan.com/support/submit-request):\n\n- `regionless-snowsight-privatelink-url`\n- `privatelink-account-name`\n- `snowsight-privatelink-url`\n- `privatelink-account-url`\n- `privatelink-connection-ocsp-urls`\n- `privatelink-pls-id`\n- `regionless-privatelink-account-url`\n- `privatelink_ocsp-url`\n- `privatelink-connection-urls`\n\nAtlan support will finish the configuration on the Atlan side using these values. Support will then provide you with the Snowflake private endpoint resource ID and Azure token for you to approve the request.\n\n## Approve the endpoint connection request [‚Äã](https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/data-warehouses/snowflake/how-tos/set-up-an-azure-private-network-link-to-snowflake\\#approve-the-endpoint-connection-request \"Direct link to Approve the endpoint connection request\")\n\nLog in to snowCLI using the `ACCOUNTADMIN` account, and run the following commands:\n\n```codeBlockLines_e6Vv\nuse role accountadmin;\nSELECT SYSTEM$AUTHORIZE_PRIVATELINK (\n  '/subscriptions/26d.../resourcegroups/sf-1/providers/microsoft.network/privateendpoints/test-self-service',\n  'eyJ...'\n  );\n\n```\n\nSnowflake will return an `Account¬†is¬†authorized¬†for¬†PrivateLink.` message to confirm successful authorization. The status of the private endpoint in Atlan will then change to `Approved`.\n\nWhen you use this endpoint in the configuration for [crawling](https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/data-warehouses/snowflake/how-tos/crawl-snowflake) and [mining](https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/data-warehouses/snowflake/how-tos/mine-snowflake) Snowflake, Atlan will connect to Snowflake over the Private Link.\n\n## (Optional) Configure private endpoint for internal stages [‚Äã](https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/data-warehouses/snowflake/how-tos/set-up-an-azure-private-network-link-to-snowflake\\#optional-configure-private-endpoint-for-internal-stages \"Direct link to (Optional) Configure private endpoint for internal stages\")\n\nThis is only required if you're using Snowflake internal stages. To enable Atlan to securely access your Snowflake internal stages, Atlan will require a private endpoint to your Azure storage account. Refer to [Snowflake documentation](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/private-internal-stages-azure) to learn more.\n\nTo configure an Azure private endpoint to access Snowflake internal stages:\n\n1. Open the Azure portal and navigate to your Azure Storage account.\n2. On the _Storage accounts_ page, select the storage account to connect. From the storage account menu, click **Overview**. In the _Resource JSON_ form, for _Resource ID_, click the clipboard icon to copy the value and [contact Atlan support to share the value](https://docs.atlan.com/support/submit-request). (Atlan support will finish the configuration on the Atlan side using the _Resource ID_ value and contact you to confirm endpoint creation.)\n3. From the storage account menu, click **Security + networking** and then click **Networking**.\n4. On the _Networking_ page, change to the **Private endpoint connections** tab and then approve the endpoint connection request from Atlan.\n\n- [Prerequisites](https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/data-warehouses/snowflake/how-tos/set-up-an-azure-private-network-link-to-snowflake#prerequisites)\n- [Fetch Private Link information](https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/data-warehouses/snowflake/how-tos/set-up-an-azure-private-network-link-to-snowflake#fetch-private-link-information)\n- [Share details with Atlan support team](https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/data-warehouses/snowflake/how-tos/set-up-an-azure-private-network-link-to-snowflake#share-details-with-atlan-support-team)\n- [Approve the endpoint connection request](https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/data-warehouses/snowflake/how-tos/set-up-an-azure-private-network-link-to-snowflake#approve-the-endpoint-connection-request)\n- [(Optional) Configure private endpoint for internal stages](https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/data-warehouses/snowflake/how-tos/set-up-an-azure-private-network-link-to-snowflake#optional-configure-private-endpoint-for-internal-stages)\n\n‚úï\n\nHi there, I'm Ask AI.

In the top right of any screen, navigate to **New** and then click **New Workflow**.\n2. From the list of packages, select **Snowflake Assets** and click on **Setup Workflow**.\n\n## Provide credentials [‚Äã](https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/data-warehouses/snowflake/how-tos/crawl-snowflake\\#provide-credentials \"Direct link to Provide credentials\")\n\nChoose your extraction method:\n\n- In **Direct** extraction, Atlan connects to your database and crawls metadata directly.\n- In **Offline** extraction, you will need to first [extract metadata yourself](https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/database/on-premises-databases/how-tos/set-up-on-premises-database-access) and [make it available in S3](https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/database/on-premises-databases/how-tos/crawl-on-premises-databases). This is currently only supported when using the [information schema extraction method to fetch metadata with basic authentication](https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/database/on-premises-databases/references/supported-connections-for-on-premises-databases).\n- In **Agent** extraction, Atlan's secure agent executes metadata extraction within the organization's environment.\n\n### Direct extraction method [‚Äã](https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/data-warehouses/snowflake/how-tos/crawl-snowflake\\#direct-extraction-method \"Direct link to Direct extraction method\")\n\nTo enter your Snowflake credentials:\n\n1. For _Account Identifiers (Host)_, enter the hostname, [AWS PrivateLink endpoint](https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/data-warehouses/snowflake/how-tos/set-up-an-aws-private-network-link-to-snowflake), or [Azure Private Link endpoint](https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/data-warehouses/snowflake/how-tos/set-up-an-azure-private-network-link-to-snowflake) for your Snowflake instance.\n2. For _Authentication_, choose the method you configured when [setting up the Snowflake user](https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/data-warehouses/snowflake/how-tos/set-up-snowflake#create-a-user):\n   - For **Basic** authentication, enter the _Username_ and _Password_ you configured in either Snowflake or the identity provider.\n\n\n\n     info\n\n\n\n\n\n     üí™ **Did you know?** Snowflake recommends transitioning away from basic authentication using username and password. Change to [key-pair authentication](https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/data-warehouses/snowflake/how-tos/set-up-snowflake#create-a-user) for enhanced security. For any existing Snowflake workflows, you can [modify the crawler configuration](https://docs.atlan.com/product/connections/how-tos/manage-connectivity) to update the authentication method.\n\n   - For **Keypair** authentication, enter the _Username_, _Encrypted Private Key_, and _Private Key_ _Password_ you configured. Atlan only supports encrypted private keys with a non-empty passphrase - generally recommended as more secure. An empty passphrase will result in workflow failures. To generate an encrypted private key, refer to [Snowflake documentation](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/key-pair-auth).\n\n   - For **Okta SSO** authentication,¬†enter the _Username_,¬†_Password_, and _Authenticator_ you configured. The _Authenticator_ will be the [Okta URL endpoint of your Okta account](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/admin-security-fed-auth-use#native-sso-okta-only), typically in the form of `https://<okta_account_name>.okta.com`.\n3. For _Role_, select the Snowflake role through which the crawler should run.\n4. For _Warehouse_, select the Snowflake warehouse in which the crawler should run.\n5. Click **Test Authentication** to confirm connectivity to Snowflake using these details.\n6. Once successful, at the bottom of the screen, click **Next**.\n\n### Offline extraction method [‚Äã](https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/data-warehouses/snowflake/how-tos/crawl-snowflake\\#offline-extraction-method \"Direct link to Offline extraction method\")\n\nAtlan supports the [offline extraction method](https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/database/on-premises-databases/how-tos/set-up-on-premises-database-access) for fetching metadata from Snowflake. This method uses Atlan's metadata-extractor tool to fetch metadata. You will need to first [extract the metadata](https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/database/on-premises-databases/how-tos/set-up-on-premises-database-access) yourself and then [make it available in S3](https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/database/on-premises-databases/how-tos/crawl-on-premises-databases).\n\nTo enter your S3 details:\n\n1. For _Bucket name_, enter the name of your S3 bucket. If you are reusing Atlan's S3 bucket, you can leave this blank.\n2. For¬†_Bucket prefix_, enter the S3 prefix under which all the metadata files exist. These include `databases.json`, `columns-<database>.json`, and so on.\n3. For _Bucket region_, enter the name of the S3 region.\n4. When complete, at the bottom of the screen, click **Next**.\n\n## Configure the connection [‚Äã](https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/data-warehouses/snowflake/how-tos/crawl-snowflake\\#configure-the-connection \"Direct link to Configure the connection\")\n\nTo complete the Snowflake connection configuration:\n\n1. Provide a _Connection Name_ that represents your source environment. For example, you might use values like `production`, `development`, `gold`, or `analytics`.\n\n2. (Optional) To change the users able to manage this connection, change the users or groups listed under _Connection Admins_.\n\n\n\ndanger\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you do not specify any user or group, nobody will be able to manage the connection - not even admins.\n\n3. (Optional) To prevent users from querying any Snowflake data, change _Allow SQL Query_ to **No**.\n\n4. (Optional) To prevent users from previewing any Snowflake data, change _Allow Data Preview_ to **No**.\n\n5. At the bottom of the screen, click **Next** to proceed.\n\n\n### Agent extraction method [‚Äã](https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/data-warehouses/snowflake/how-tos/crawl-snowflake\\#agent-extraction-method \"Direct link to Agent extraction method\")\n\nAtlan supports using a Secure Agent for fetching metadata from Snowflake. To use a Secure Agent, follow these steps:\n\n1. Select the **Agent** tab.\n2. Configure the Snowflake data source by adding the secret keys for your secret store. For details on the required fields, refer to the [Direct extraction](https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/data-warehouses/snowflake/how-tos/crawl-snowflake#direct-extraction-method) section.\n3. Complete the Secure Agent configuration by following the instructions in the [How to configure Secure Agent for workflow execution](https://docs.atlan.com/secure-agent/how-tos/configure-secure-agent-for-workflow-execution) guide.\n4. Click **Next** after completing the configuration.\n\n## Configure the crawler [‚Äã](https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/data-warehouses/snowflake/how-tos/crawl-snowflake\\#configure-the-crawler \"Direct link to Configure the crawler\")\n\ndanger\n\nWhen [modifying](https://docs.atlan.com/product/connections/how-tos/manage-connectivity) an existing Snowflake connection, switching to a different [extraction method](https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/data-warehouses/snowflake/how-tos/set-up-snowflake#choose-metadata-fetching-method) will delete and recreate all assets in the existing connection. If you'd like to change the extraction method, [contact Atlan support](https://docs.atlan.com/support/submit-request)¬†for assistance.\n\nBefore running the Snowflake crawler, you can further configure it.\n\nYou must select the _Extraction method_ you configured when you [set up Snowflake](https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/data-warehouses/snowflake/how-tos/set-up-snowflake):\n\n- For **Information Schema** [method](https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/data-warehouses/snowflake/how-tos/set-up-snowflake#choose-metadata-fetching-method), keep the default selection.\n- Change to **Account Usage** [method](https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/data-warehouses/snowflake/how-tos/set-up-snowflake#choose-metadata-fetching-method)¬†and specify the following:\n  - _Database Name_ of the copied Snowflake database\n  - _Schema Name_ of the copied `ACCOUNT_USAGE` schema\n  - **Incremental extraction** Public preview \\- Toggle incremental extraction for faster and more efficient metadata extraction.\n\nYou can override the defaults for any of the remaining options:\n\n- For _Asset selection_, select a filtering option:\n  - To select the assets you want to include in crawling, click **Include by hierarchy** and filter for assets down to the database or schema level. (This will default to all assets, if none are specified.)\n  - To have the crawler include _Databases_, _Schemas_, or _Tables & Views_ based on a naming convention, click **Include by regex** and specify a regular expression - for example, specifying `ATLAN_EXAMPLE_DB.*` for _Databases_ will include all the matching databases and their child assets.\n  - To select the assets you want to exclude from crawling, click **Exclude by hierarchy** and filter for assets down to the database or schema level. (This will default to no assets, if none are specified.)\n  - To have the crawler ignore _Databases_, _Schemas_, or _Tables & Views_ based on a naming convention, click **Exclude by regex** and specify a regular expression - for example, specifying `ATLAN_EXAMPLE_TABLES.*` for _Tables & Views_ will exclude all the matching tables and views.\n  - Click **+** to add more filters. If you add multiple filters, assets will be crawled based on matching _all_ the filtering conditions you have set.\n- To exclude lineage for views in Snowflake, change _View Definition Lineage_ to **No**.\n\n- To [import tags from Snowflake to Atlan](https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/data-warehouses/snowflake/how-tos/manage-snowflake-tags), change _Import Tags_ to **Yes**. Note the following:\n\n\n  - If using the _Account Usage_ extraction method, [grant the same permissions](https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/data-warehouses/snowflake/how-tos/set-up-snowflake#grant-permissions-for-account-usage-method) as required for crawling Snowflake assets to import tags and push updated tags to Snowflake.\n  - If using the _Information Schema_ extraction method, note that Snowflake [stores all tag objects](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/object-tagging#discover-tags) in the `ACCOUNT_USAGE` schema. You will need to [grant permissions on the account usage schema instead to import tags](https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/data-warehouses/snowflake/how-tos/set-up-snowflake#grant-permissions-for-account-usage-method) from Snowflake.\n\ndanger\n\nObject tagging in Snowflake currently requires [Enterprise Edition or higher](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/intro-editions#feature-edition-matrix). If your organization does not have Enterprise Edition or higher and you try to import Snowflake tags to Atlan, the Snowflake connection will fail with an error - unable to retrieve tags.\n\n- For _Control Config_, keep _Default_ for the default configuration or click **Custom** to further configure the crawler:\n  - If you have received a custom crawler configuration from Atlan support, for _Custom Config_, enter the value provided. You can also:\n    - Enter `{\"ignore-all-case\": true}` to enable crawling assets with case-sensitive identifiers.\n  - For _Enable Source Level Filtering_, click **True** to enable schema-level filtering at source or keep _False_ to disable it.\n  - For _Use JDBC Internal Methods_, click **True** to enable JDBC internal methods for data extraction or click **False** to disable it.\n  - For _Exclude tables with empty data_, change to **Yes** to exclude any tables and corresponding columns without any data.\n  - For _Exclude views_, change to **Yes** to exclude all views from crawling.\n\n**Did you know?**\n\nIf an asset appears in both the include and exclude filters, the exclude filter takes precedence.\n\n## Run the crawler [‚Äã](https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/data-warehouses/snowflake/how-tos/crawl-snowflake\\#run-the-crawler \"Direct link to Run the crawler\")\n\nTo run the Snowflake crawler, after completing the steps above:\n\n1. To check for any [permissions or other configuration issues](https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/data-warehouses/snowflake/references/preflight-checks-for-snowflake) before running the crawler, click **Preflight checks**.\n2. You can either:\n   - To run the crawler once immediately, at the bottom of the screen, click the **Run** button.\n   - To schedule the crawler to run hourly, daily, weekly, or monthly, at the bottom of the screen, click the **Schedule Run** button.\n\nOnce the crawler has completed running, you will see the assets in Atlan's asset page! üéâ\n\nNote that the Atlan crawler will currently skip any unsupported data types to ensure a successful workflow run.\n\n- [Select the source](https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/data-warehouses/snowflake/how-tos/crawl-snowflake#select-the-source)\n- [Provide credentials](https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/data-warehouses/snowflake/how-tos/crawl-snowflake#provide-credentials)\n- [Configure the connection](https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/data-warehouses/snowflake/how-tos/crawl-snowflake#configure-the-connection)\n- [Configure the crawler](https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/data-warehouses/snowflake/how-tos/crawl-snowflake#configure-the-crawler)\n- [Run the crawler](https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/data-warehouses/snowflake/how-tos/crawl-snowflake#run-the-crawler)\n\n‚úï\n\nHi there, I'm Ask AI.

This role is used to create and manage the database objects required for data quality operations.\n- Atlan data quality service role ( `atlan_dq_service_role`) \\- a service role that Atlan will use to interact with Snowflake objects related to data quality operations. This role will be assigned to the Atlan service user.\n\n### Create data quality admin role [‚Äã](https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/data-warehouses/snowflake/how-tos/configure-snowflake-data-metric-functions\\#create-data-quality-admin-role \"Direct link to Create data quality admin role\")\n\nRun the following commands to create the `dq_admin` role and grant access to the Snowflake warehouse:\n\n```codeBlockLines_e6Vv\nCREATE OR REPLACE ROLE dq_admin;\nGRANT OPERATE, USAGE ON WAREHOUSE \"<warehouse-name>\" TO ROLE dq_admin;\n\n```\n\n- Replace `<warehouse-name>` with the name of your dedicated Snowflake warehouse for running data quality-related queries.\n\n### Create Atlan data quality service role [‚Äã](https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/data-warehouses/snowflake/how-tos/configure-snowflake-data-metric-functions\\#create-atlan-data-quality-service-role \"Direct link to Create Atlan data quality service role\")\n\nRun the following commands to create the `atlan_dq_service_role` and grant access to the Snowflake warehouse:\n\n```codeBlockLines_e6Vv\nCREATE OR REPLACE ROLE atlan_dq_service_role;\nGRANT OPERATE, USAGE ON WAREHOUSE \"<warehouse-name>\" TO ROLE atlan_dq_service_role;\n\n```\n\n- Replace `<warehouse-name>` with the name of your dedicated Snowflake warehouse for running data quality-related queries.\n\n## Create a user in Snowflake [‚Äã](https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/data-warehouses/snowflake/how-tos/configure-snowflake-data-metric-functions\\#create-a-user-in-snowflake \"Direct link to Create a user in Snowflake\")\n\nA dedicated Snowflake user is required for Atlan to connect to your Snowflake instance.

This document describes the steps to set this up between Snowflake and Atlan, when you use our Single Tenant SaaS deployment.\n\nWho can do this?\n\nYou will need Snowflake Support, and probably your Snowflake administrator involved - you may not have access or the tools to run these tasks.\n\n## Prerequisites [‚Äã](https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/data-warehouses/snowflake/how-tos/set-up-an-aws-private-network-link-to-snowflake\\#prerequisites \"Direct link to Prerequisites\")\n\n- Snowflake must be setup with Business Critical Edition (or higher).\n- Open a ticket with Snowflake Support to enable PrivateLink for your Snowflake account.\n- Snowflake support will take 1-2 days to review and enable PrivateLink.\n- If you are using IP allowlist in your Snowflake instance, you must add the Atlan IP to the allowlist. Please [raise a support request](https://docs.atlan.com/support/submit-request) to do so.\n\n(For all details, see the [Snowflake documentation](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/admin-security-privatelink.html).)\n\n## Fetch PrivateLink information [‚Äã](https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/data-warehouses/snowflake/how-tos/set-up-an-aws-private-network-link-to-snowflake\\#fetch-privatelink-information \"Direct link to Fetch PrivateLink information\")\n\nLog in to snowCLI using the `ACCOUNTADMIN` account, and run the following commands:\n\n```codeBlockLines_e6Vv\nuse role accountadmin;\nselect system$get_privatelink_config();\n\n```\n\nThis will produce output like the following (formatted here for readability):\n\n```codeBlockLines_e6Vv\n{\n  \"privatelink-account-name\":\"abc123.ap-south-1.privatelink\",\n  \"privatelink-vpce-id\":\"com.amazonaws.vpce.ap-south-1.vpce-svc-257a4d536bd8e3594\",\n  \"privatelink-account-url\":\"abc123.ap-south-1.privatelink.snowflakecomputing.com\",\n  \"regionless-privatelink-account-url\":\"xyz789-abc123.privatelink.snowflakecomputing.com\",\n  \"privatelink_ocsp-url\":\"ocsp.abc123.ap-south-1.privatelink.snowflakecomputing.com\",\n  \"privatelink-connection-urls\":\"[]\"\n}\n\n```\n\n## Share details with Atlan support team [‚Äã](https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/data-warehouses/snowflake/how-tos/set-up-an-aws-private-network-link-to-snowflake\\#share-details-with-atlan-support-team \"Direct link to Share details with Atlan support team\")\n\nShare the following values with the [Atlan support](https://docs.atlan.com/support/submit-request) team:\n\n- `privatelink-account-name`\n- `privatelink-vpce-id`\n- `privatelink-account-url`\n- `privatelink_ocsp-url`\n\nAtlan support will finish the configuration on the Atlan side using these values.

[‚Äã](https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/data-warehouses/google-bigquery/troubleshooting/troubleshooting-google-bigquery-connectivity\\#does-atlan-support-nested-columns-beyond-level-1 \"Direct link to Does Atlan support nested columns beyond level 1?\")\n\nAtlan gets the raw structure for nested columns beyond level 1 from JSON files, which are then parsed and rendered on the table asset sidebar. However, nested columns beyond level 1 can only be viewed and not enriched with metadata. For example, if you [attach a tag](https://docs.atlan.com/product/capabilities/governance/tags/how-tos/attach-a-tag) to a level 1 column, the tag will not be propagated to the nested columns.\n\n#### What are the known limitations of generating lineage for nested columns? [‚Äã](https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/data-warehouses/google-bigquery/troubleshooting/troubleshooting-google-bigquery-connectivity\\#what-are-the-known-limitations-of-generating-lineage-for-nested-columns \"Direct link to What are the known limitations of generating lineage for nested columns?\")\n\nThe following examples illustrate the known limitations of generating lineage for Google BigQuery nested columns in Atlan:\n\n- Lineage will not be generated if you use the nested column of a `RECORD` in the source table or view to create another nested column for a `RECORD REPEATED` column in the target table or view. For example:\n\n\n\n\n\n```codeBlockLines_e6Vv\nCREATE VIEW orders_view AS\nSELECT\n    ARRAY(SELECT AS STRUCT\n      customer.name AS customer_name,\n      order_id AS order_id\n    ) AS orders\nFROM\n    orders_raw;\n\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  - Lineage will be generated for: `orders_raw.order_id` ‚Üí `orders_view.orders.order_id`\n  - Lineage will not be generated for: `orders_raw.customer.name` ‚Üí `orders_view.orders.customer_name`\n- Lineage will not be generated for a nested column if you use the `RECORD` column as well as a level 1 nested column in the source table or view to create a target column in another table or view. For example:\n\n\n\n\n\n```codeBlockLines_e6Vv\nCREATE VIEW orders_view AS\nSELECT\n    customer AS customer;\n    customer.name AS customer_name,\n    order_id AS order_id\nFROM\n    orders_raw;\n\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  - Lineage will be generated for:\n    - `orders_raw.customer` ‚Üí `orders_view.customer`\n    - `orders_raw.customer.address.city` ‚Üí `orders_view.city`\n  - Lineage will not be generated for: `orders_raw.customer.name` ‚Üí `orders_view.customer_name`. Instead, lineage will be generated between `orders_raw.customer` ‚Üí `orders_view.customer_name`.\n- Lineage will not be generated for a nested column if you use a table alias to refer to nested columns in a source table or view to create a target column in another table or view. For example:\n\n\n\n\n\n```codeBlockLines_e6Vv\nCREATE VIEW orders_view AS\nSELECT\n    o.order_id AS order_id\n    o.customer.name as customer_name\n    o.customer.address.city as city\nFROM\n    orders_raw o;\n\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  - Lineage will be generated for: `orders_raw.order_id` ‚Üí `orders_view.order_id`\n  - Lineage will not be generated for:\n    - `orders_raw.customer.name` ‚Üí `orders_view.customer_name`\n    - `orders_raw.customer.address.city` ‚Üí `orders_view.city`\n- Lineage will not be generated for a nested column if you use a source table or view `CROSS JOIN` with `UNNEST` to create a target table or view. For example:\n\n\n\n\n\n```codeBlockLines_e6Vv\nCREATE VIEW orders_view AS\nSELECT\n    order_id,\n    customer.name as customer_name,\n    customer.address.city as city,\n    i.item_name AS item_name\nFROM\n    orders_raw CROSS JOIN UNNEST(items) AS i;\n\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  - Lineage will be generated for: `orders_raw.order_id` ‚Üí `orders_view.order_id`\n  - Lineage will not be generated for:\n    - `orders_raw.customer.name` ‚Üí `orders_view.customer_name`\n    - `orders_raw.customer.address.city` ‚Üí `orders_view.city`\n    - `orders_raw.items.item_name` ‚Üí `orders_view.item_name`\n\n#### How to debug test authentication and preflight check errors?

In the top right of any screen, navigate to¬†**New** and then click¬†**New Workflow**.\n2. From the filters along the top, click **Miner**.\n3. From the list of packages, select **BigQuery Miner** and then click **Setup Workflow**.\n\n## Configure the miner [‚Äã](https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/data-warehouses/google-bigquery/how-tos/mine-google-bigquery\\#configure-the-miner \"Direct link to Configure the miner\")\n\nTo configure the Google BigQuery miner:\n\n1. For _Connection_, select the connection to mine. (To select a connection, [the crawler](https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/data-warehouses/google-bigquery/how-tos/crawl-google-bigquery) must have already run.)\n\n2. For _Miner Extraction Method_, select **Query History**.\n\n3. For _Start time_, choose the earliest date from which to mine query history.\n\n\n\ninfo\n\n\n\n\n\nüí™ **Did you know?** The miner restricts you to only querying the past two weeks of query history. If you need to query more history, for example in an initial load, consider using the [S3 miner](https://docs.atlan.com/product/connections/how-tos/mine-queries-through-s3) first. After the initial load, you can [modify the miner's configuration](https://docs.atlan.com/product/connections/how-tos/manage-connectivity) to use query history extraction.\n\n4. (Optional) By default, the miner fetches data from the US region. To fetch data from [another region](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/locations), for _Region_, select **Custom** and then enter the region where your `INFORMATION_SCHEMA` is hosted under _Custom BigQuery Region_. Enter the region in the [following format](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/information-schema-intro#region_qualifier) `region-<REGION>`, replacing `<REGION>` with your specific region - for example, `europe-north1`.\n\n5. To check for any permissions or other configuration issues before running the miner, click **Preflight checks**.\n\n6. At the bottom of the screen, click **Next** to proceed.\n\n\ndanger\n\nIf running the miner for the first time, Atlan recommends setting a start date roughly three days prior to the current date and then scheduling it daily to build up to two weeks of query history. Mining two weeks of query history on the first miner run may cause delays. Atlan requires a minimum lag of 24 to 48 hours to capture all the relevant transformations that were part of a session. Learn more about the miner logic [here](https://docs.atlan.com/product/capabilities/lineage/troubleshooting/troubleshooting-lineage#miner-logic).\n\n## Configure the miner behavior [‚Äã](https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/data-warehouses/google-bigquery/how-tos/mine-google-bigquery\\#configure-the-miner-behavior \"Direct link to Configure the miner behavior\")\n\nTo configure the Google BigQuery miner behavior:\n\n1. (Optional) For _Calculate popularity_, change to **True** to retrieve [usage and popularity metrics](https://docs.atlan.com/product/capabilities/usage-and-popularity/how-tos/interpret-usage-metrics) for your Google BigQuery assets from query history:\n1. To select a [pricing model for running queries](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/pricing), for _Pricing Model_, click **On Demand** to be charged for the number of bytes processed or **Flat Rate** for the number of slots purchased.\n2. For _Popularity Window (days)_, 30 days is the maximum limit. You can set a shorter popularity window of less than 30 days.\n3.

This method uses Atlan's tableau-extractor tool to fetch metadata. You will need to first [extract the metadata](https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/business-intelligence/tableau/how-tos/set-up-on-premises-tableau-access) yourself and then [make it available in S3](https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/business-intelligence/tableau/how-tos/crawl-on-premises-tableau).\n\nTo enter your S3 details:\n\n1. For¬†_Bucket name_, enter the name of your S3 bucket.\n2. For¬†_Bucket prefix_, enter the S3 prefix under which all the metadata files exist.

To use a Secure Agent, follow these steps:\n\n1. Select the **Agent** tab.\n2. Configure the Tableau data source by adding the secret keys for your secret store. For details on the required fields, refer to the [Direct extraction](https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/business-intelligence/tableau/how-tos/crawl-tableau#direct-extraction-method) section.\n3. Complete the Secure Agent configuration by following the instructions in the [How to configure Secure Agent for workflow execution](https://docs.atlan.com/secure-agent/how-tos/configure-secure-agent-for-workflow-execution) guide.\n4. Click **Next** after completing the configuration.\n\n## Configure the connection [‚Äã](https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/business-intelligence/tableau/how-tos/crawl-tableau\\#configure-the-connection \"Direct link to Configure the connection\")\n\nTo complete the Tableau connection configuration:\n\n1. Provide a _Connection Name_ that represents your source environment. For example, you might want to use values like `production`, `development`, `gold`, or `analytics`.\n\n2. (Optional) To change the users able to manage this connection, change the users or groups listed under _Connection Admins_.\n\n\n\ndanger\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you do not specify any user or group, nobody will be able to manage the connection - not even admins.\n\n\n## Configure the crawler [‚Äã](https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/business-intelligence/tableau/how-tos/crawl-tableau\\#configure-the-crawler \"Direct link to Configure the crawler\")\n\nBefore running the Tableau crawler, you can further configure it.\n\n1. On the _Metadata_ page, you can override the defaults for any of these options:\n   - To select the Tableau projects you want to include in crawling, click **Include Projects**. (This will default to all assets, if none are specified.)\n   - To select the Tableau projects you want to exclude from crawling, click **Exclude Projects**. (This will default to no assets, if none are specified.)\n   - To have the crawler ignore Tableau projects based on a naming convention, specify a regular expression in the _Exclude Projects Regex_ field.\n2. To check for any [permissions or other configuration issues](https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/business-intelligence/tableau/references/preflight-checks-for-tableau) before running the crawler, click **Preflight checks**.\n\n**Did you know?**\n\nIf a project appears in both the include and exclude filters, the exclude filter takes precedence. (The _Exclude Projects Regex_ also takes precedence.)\n\n## Configure advanced controls [‚Äã](https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/business-intelligence/tableau/how-tos/crawl-tableau\\#configure-advanced-controls \"Direct link to Configure advanced controls\")\n\nBefore running the Tableau crawler, you can also configure advanced controls for the crawler.\n\nOn the _Advanced_ page, you can override the defaults for any of these options:\n\n- For _Alternate Host URL_, enter the protocol and host name to be used for viewing assets directly in Tableau.\n- For _Crawl Unpublished Worksheets and Dashboards_, click **Yes** to enable crawling hidden worksheets and dashboards or **No** to skip crawling them.\n- For _Hidden Datasource Fields_, click **Yes** to enable crawling hidden datasource fields or **No** to skip crawling them.\n- Crawl embedded dashboards: Embedded dashboard here means linking or displaying a dashboard inside another dashboard by providing a link to the dashboard in a Web Page item of the embedding dashboard.\n  - Click **Yes** to enable relationships between different embedded dashboards.\n  - Click **No** to skip creating relationships between embedded dashboards.\n\n## Run the crawler [‚Äã](https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/business-intelligence/tableau/how-tos/crawl-tableau\\#run-the-crawler \"Direct link to Run the crawler\")\n\nTo run the Tableau crawler, after completing the steps above:\n\n- You can either:\n  - To run the crawler once immediately, at the bottom of the screen, click the **Run** button.\n  - To schedule the crawler to run hourly, daily, weekly, or monthly, at the bottom of the screen, click the **Schedule Run** button.\n\nOnce the crawler has completed running, you will see the assets in Atlan's asset page! üéâ\n\n- [Select the source](https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/business-intelligence/tableau/how-tos/crawl-tableau#select-the-source)\n- [Provide credentials](https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/business-intelligence/tableau/how-tos/crawl-tableau#provide-credentials)\n- [Configure the connection](https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/business-intelligence/tableau/how-tos/crawl-tableau#configure-the-connection)\n- [Configure the crawler](https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/business-intelligence/tableau/how-tos/crawl-tableau#configure-the-crawler)\n- [Configure advanced controls](https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/business-intelligence/tableau/how-tos/crawl-tableau#configure-advanced-controls)\n- [Run the crawler](https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/business-intelligence/tableau/how-tos/crawl-tableau#run-the-crawler)",

In addition, JWT authorization currently does not support all [REST API capabilities](https://help.tableau.com/current/online/en-us/connected_apps_scopes.htm#scopes). Due to these limitations at source, Atlan will not be able to crawl [Tableau flows](https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/business-intelligence/tableau/references/what-does-atlan-crawl-from-tableau) if you use the JWT bearer authentication method.\n\n#### Configure a connected app [‚Äã](https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/business-intelligence/tableau/how-tos/set-up-tableau\\#configure-a-connected-app \"Direct link to Configure a connected app\")\n\nIf you want to access Tableau using a JSON web token (JWT), you can configure a Tableau connected app. There are two types of connected apps that you can configure - direct trust or OAuth 2.0 trust.\n\nTo authenticate the Tableau connection in Atlan using this method, you will need the following:\n\n- Username - your Tableau Server username or Tableau Online email address, the user must have a [_Site Administrator Explorer_ role](https://help.tableau.com/current/online/en-us/permission_license_siterole.htm)\n\n- Connected app ID - client ID generated for the connected app\n\n- Secret ID - secret ID linked to the client ID of the connected app\n\n- Secret value - secret value used to sign the token\n\n\nTo configure a connected app, follow the steps in Tableau documentation:\n\n- [Direct trust](https://help.tableau.com/current/server-linux/en-us/connected_apps_direct.htm)\n- [OAuth 2.0 trust](https://help.tableau.com/current/server-linux/en-us/connected_apps_eas.htm)\n\n#### Access scopes for connected apps [‚Äã](https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/business-intelligence/tableau/how-tos/set-up-tableau\\#access-scopes-for-connected-apps \"Direct link to Access scopes for connected apps\")\n\nFor JWT authorization, [scopes](https://help.tableau.com/current/online/en-us/connected_apps_scopes.htm) define access permissions granted to the token holder. Scopes control the specific actions that an application or user can perform in Tableau while accessing content through a connected app.\n\nThe Tableau connector in Atlan uses two `read` scopes to extract metadata from Tableau. Note that the Tableau connector is preconfigured to use these scopes, no action required.\n\nAtlan uses the following scopes for JWT authentication:\n\n- `tableau:content:read` \\- allows read access to your assets in Tableau, including:\n  - Workbooks - can list, access, and retrieve metadata for workbooks.\n\n  - Views - can fetch specific views or dashboards within workbooks.\n\n  - Data sources - can access published data sources and associated metadata.\n\n  - Projects - can retrieve project metadata.\n\n  - Metrics - can read metrics associated with workbooks or dashboards.\n\n  - Tables and databases - can access metadata for tables and databases connected to Tableau.\n- `tableau:users:read` \\- allows read access to user details. This enables Atlan to display the source owner property for supported Tableau assets, including in the [impact analysis report](https://docs.atlan.com/product/capabilities/lineage/how-tos/download-and-export-lineage).\n\n- Optional) `tableau:workbooks:download` ‚Äì allows downloading a workbook ( `.twb` or `.twbx`), enabling Atlan to display relationships for embedded Tableau dashboards.\n\n\n- [Enable the Tableau Metadata API](https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/business-intelligence/tableau/how-tos/set-up-tableau#enable-the-tableau-metadata-api)\n- [Publish the worksheets you want to crawl](https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/business-intelligence/tableau/how-tos/set-up-tableau#publish-the-worksheets-you-want-to-crawl)\n- [Choose authentication mechanism](https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/business-intelligence/tableau/how-tos/set-up-tableau#choose-authentication-mechanism)\n\n‚úï\n\nHi there, I'm Ask AI.

Log into the server with Docker Compose installed.\n2. Change to the directory containing the compose file.\n3. Run Docker Compose: `sudo docker-compose up`\n\n### Crawl a specific connection [‚Äã](https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/business-intelligence/tableau/how-tos/crawl-on-premises-tableau\\#crawl-a-specific-connection \"Direct link to Crawl a specific connection\")\n\nTo crawl a specific Tableau connection using the tableau-extractor tool:\n\n1. Log into the server with Docker Compose installed.\n2. Change to the directory containing the compose file.\n3. Run Docker Compose: `sudo docker-compose up <connection-name>`\n\n(Replace `<connection-name>` with the name of the connection from the `services` section of the compose file.)\n\n## (Optional) Review generated files [‚Äã](https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/business-intelligence/tableau/how-tos/crawl-on-premises-tableau\\#optional-review-generated-files \"Direct link to (Optional) Review generated files\")\n\nThe tableau-extractor tool will generate many folders with JSON files for each `service`. For example:\n\n- `calculated_fields`\n- `dashboards`\n- `datasources`\n- `workbooks`\n- and many others\n\nYou can inspect the metadata and make sure it is acceptable for providing metadata to Atlan.\n\n## Upload generated files to S3 [‚Äã](https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/business-intelligence/tableau/how-tos/crawl-on-premises-tableau\\#upload-generated-files-to-s3 \"Direct link to Upload generated files to S3\")\n\nTo provide Atlan access to the extracted metadata, you will need to upload the metadata to an S3 bucket.\n\n**Did you know?**\n\nWe recommend uploading to the same S3 bucket as Atlan uses to avoid access issues. Reach out to your Data Success Manager to get the details of your Atlan bucket. To create your own bucket, refer to the [Create your own S3 bucket](https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/etl-tools/dbt/how-tos/set-up-dbt-core) section of the dbt documentation. (The steps will be exactly the same.)\n\nTo upload the metadata to S3:\n\n1. Ensure that all files for a particular connection have the same prefix. For example, `output/tableau-example/dashboards/result-0.json`, `output/tableau-example/workbooks/result-0.json`, and so on.\n2. [Upload the files to the S3 bucket](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/upload-objects.html) using your preferred method.\n\nFor example, to upload all files using the [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html):\n\n```codeBlockLines_e6Vv\naws s3 cp output/tableau-example s3://my-bucket/metadata/tableau-example --recursive\n\n```\n\n## Crawl metadata in Atlan [‚Äã](https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/business-intelligence/tableau/how-tos/crawl-on-premises-tableau\\#crawl-metadata-in-atlan \"Direct link to Crawl metadata in Atlan\")\n\nOnce you have extracted metadata on-premises and uploaded the results to S3, you can crawl the metadata into Atlan:\n\n- [How to crawl Tableau](https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/business-intelligence/tableau/how-tos/crawl-tableau)\n\nBe sure you select **Offline** for the _Extraction method_.\n\n- [Run tableau-extractor](https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/business-intelligence/tableau/how-tos/crawl-on-premises-tableau#run-tableau-extractor)\n- [(Optional) Review generated files](https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/business-intelligence/tableau/how-tos/crawl-on-premises-tableau#optional-review-generated-files)\n- [Upload generated files to S3](https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/business-intelligence/tableau/how-tos/crawl-on-premises-tableau#upload-generated-files-to-s3)\n- [Crawl metadata in Atlan](https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/business-intelligence/tableau/how-tos/crawl-on-premises-tableau#crawl-metadata-in-atlan)\n\n‚úï\n\nHi there, I'm Ask AI.

You will also need your Tableau instance details, including credentials.\n\nIn some cases you may not be able to expose your Tableau instance for Atlan to crawl and ingest metadata. For example, this may happen when security requirements restrict access to sensitive, mission-critical data.\n\nIn such cases you may want to decouple the extraction of metadata from its ingestion in Atlan. This approach gives you full control over your resources and metadata transfer to Atlan.\n\n## Prerequisites [‚Äã](https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/business-intelligence/tableau/how-tos/set-up-on-premises-tableau-access\\#prerequisites \"Direct link to Prerequisites\")\n\nTo extract metadata from your on-premises Tableau instance, you will need to use Atlan's tableau-extractor tool.\n\n**Did you know?**\n\nAtlan uses exactly the same tableau-extractor behind the scenes when it connects to Tableau in the cloud.\n\n### Install Docker Compose [‚Äã](https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/business-intelligence/tableau/how-tos/set-up-on-premises-tableau-access\\#install-docker-compose \"Direct link to Install Docker Compose\")\n\n[Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) is a tool for defining and running applications composed of many [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/overview/) containers. (Any guesses where the name came from? üòâ)\n\nTo install Docker Compose:\n\n1. [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)\n2. [Install Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)\n\n**Did you know?**\n\nInstructions provided in this documentation should be enough even if you are completely new to Docker and Docker Compose. However, you can also walk through the [Get started with Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/gettingstarted/) tutorial if you want to learn Docker Compose basics first.\n\n### Get the tableau-extractor tool [‚Äã](https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/business-intelligence/tableau/how-tos/set-up-on-premises-tableau-access\\#get-the-tableau-extractor-tool \"Direct link to Get the tableau-extractor tool\")\n\nTo get the tableau-extractor tool:\n\n1. [Raise a support ticket](https://docs.atlan.com/support/submit-request) to get the link to the latest version.\n\n2. Download the image using the link provided by support.\n\n3. Load the image to the server you'll use to crawl Tableau:\n\n\n\n\n\n```codeBlockLines_e6Vv\nsudo docker load -i /path/to/tableau-extractor-master.tar\n\n```\n\n\n## Get the compose file [‚Äã](https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/business-intelligence/tableau/how-tos/set-up-on-premises-tableau-access\\#get-the-compose-file \"Direct link to Get the compose file\")\n\nAtlan provides you with a [Docker compose file](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/) for the tableau-extractor tool.\n\nTo get the compose file:\n\n1. Download the [latest compose file](https://atlan-public.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/atlan/tableau-extractor/docker-compose.yaml).\n2. Save the file to an empty directory on the server you'll use to access your on-premises Tableau instance.\n3. The file is `docker-compose.yaml`.\n\n## Define Tableau connections [‚Äã](https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/business-intelligence/tableau/how-tos/set-up-on-premises-tableau-access\\#define-tableau-connections \"Direct link to Define Tableau connections\")\n\nThe structure of the compose file includes three main sections:\n\n- `x-templates` contains configuration fragments. You should ignore this section - do not make any changes to it.\n- `services` is where you will define your Tableau connections.\n- `volumes` contains mount information. You should ignore this section as well - do not make any changes to it.\n\n### Define services [‚Äã](https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/business-intelligence/tableau/how-tos/set-up-on-premises-tableau-access\\#define-services \"Direct link to Define services\")\n\nFor each on-premises Tableau instance, define an entry under `services` in the compose file.\n\nEach entry will have the following structure:\n\n```codeBlockLines_e6Vv\nservices:\n  connection-name:\n    <<: *extract\n    environment:\n      <<: *tableau-defaults\n      EXCLUDE_PROJECTS_REGEX: \"Test1.*|Test2.*\"\n      CRAWL_UNPUBLISHED_WORKSHEETS_DASHBOARDS: \"true\"\n      CERT_PATH: \"\"\n    volumes:\n      - ./output/connection-name:/output/process\n\n```\n\n- Replace `connection-name` with the name of your connection.\n- `<<: *extract` tells the tableau-extractor tool to run.\n- `environment` contains all parameters for the tool.\n- `CERT_PATH` \\- if applicable, specify the [SSL certificate](https://docs.atlan.com/product/connections/how-tos/provide-ssl-certificates) path and store it as a new volume.\n- `volumes` specifies where to store results. In this example, the extractor will store results in the `./output/connection-name` folder on the local file system.\n\nYou can add as many Tableau connections as you want.\n\n**Did you know?**\n\n[Docker's documentation](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/#services-top-level-element) describes the `services` format in more detail.\n\n## Provide credentials [‚Äã](https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/business-intelligence/tableau/how-tos/set-up-on-premises-tableau-access\\#provide-credentials \"Direct link to Provide credentials\")\n\nTo define the credentials for your Tableau connections, you will need to provide a Tableau configuration file.\n\nThe Tableau configuration is a `.ini` file with the following format:\n\n```codeBlockLines_e6Vv\n[TableauConfig]\n# Tableau instance URL. Do not include /api/* in the URL.\nserver_url=https://:<hostname>:<port>\n# Tableau site name. Leaving this empty will select the default site.\nsite_name=YourTableauSite\n# Tableau authentication type. Options: basic, personal_access_token.\nauth_type=basic\n\n# Required only if auth_type is basic.\n[BasicAuth]\nusername=YourTableauUsername\npassword=YourTableauPassword\n\n# Required only if auth_type is personal_access_token.\n[PersonalAccessTokenAuth]\ntoken_name=YourTableauTokenName\ntoken_value=YourTableauTokenValue\n\n```\n\ndanger\n\nFor basic authentication, ensure that your password does not contain the special character `%`. If the percent sign is included in your password, add another `%` to escape it.\n\n## Secure credentials [‚Äã](https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/business-intelligence/tableau/how-tos/set-up-on-premises-tableau-access\\#secure-credentials \"Direct link to Secure credentials\")\n\n### Using local files [‚Äã](https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/business-intelligence/tableau/how-tos/set-up-on-premises-tableau-access\\#using-local-files \"Direct link to Using local files\")\n\ndanger\n\nIf you decide to keep Tableau credentials in plaintext files, we recommend you restrict access to the directory and the compose file. For extra security, we recommend you use [Docker secrets](https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/secrets/) to store the sensitive passwords.\n\nTo specify the local files in your compose file:\n\n```codeBlockLines_e6Vv\nsecrets:\n  tableau_config:\n    file: ./tableau.ini\n\n```\n\ndanger\n\nThis `secrets` section is at the same top-level as the `services` section described earlier. It is not a sub-section of the `services` section.\n\n### Using Docker secrets [‚Äã](https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/business-intelligence/tableau/how-tos/set-up-on-premises-tableau-access\\#using-docker-secrets \"Direct link to Using Docker secrets\")\n\nTo create and use Docker secrets:\n\n1. Store the Tableau configuration file:\n\n\n\n\n\n```codeBlockLines_e6Vv\nsudo docker secret create tableau_config path/to/tableau.ini\n\n```\n\n2. At the top of your compose file, add a [secrets](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/compose-file-v3/#secrets-configuration-reference) element to access your secret:\n\n\n\n\n\n```codeBlockLines_e6Vv\nsecrets:\n     tableau_config:\n       external: true\n       name: tableau_config\n\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   - The `name` should be the same one you used in the `docker secret create` command above.\n   - Once stored as a Docker secret, you can remove the local Tableau configuration file.\n3. Within the `service` section of the compose file, add a new secrets element and specify the name of the secret within your service to use it.\n\n\n## Example [‚Äã](https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/business-intelligence/tableau/how-tos/set-up-on-premises-tableau-access\\#example \"Direct link to Example\")\n\nLet's explain in detail with an example:\n\n```codeBlockLines_e6Vv\nsecrets:\n  tableau_config:\n    external: true\n    name: tableau_config\n\nx-templates:\n  # ...\n\nservices:\n  my-tableau:\n    <<: *extract\n    environment:\n      <<: *tableau-defaults\n      EXCLUDE_PROJECTS_REGEX: \"Test1.*|Test2.*\"\n      CRAWL_UNPUBLISHED_WORKSHEETS_DASHBOARDS: \"true\"\n      CERT_PATH: \"/tmp/tab-cert.pem\"\n    volumes:\n      - ./output/my-tableau:/output/process\n      - ./tab-cert.pem:/tmp/tab-cert.pem\n    secrets:\n      - tableau_config\n\n```\n\n1. In this example, we've defined the secrets at the top of the file (you could also define them at the bottom). The `tableau_config` refers to an external Docker secret created using the `docker secret create` command.\n2. The name of this service is `my-tableau`. You can use any meaningful name you want.\n3. The `<<: *tableau-defaults` sets the connection type to Tableau.\n4. `EXCLUDE_PROJECTS_REGEX` tells the extractor to filter out all the projects whose names match the `Test1.*` and `Test2.*` regex patterns in the extracted metadata.\n5. `CRAWL_UNPUBLISHED_WORKSHEETS_DASHBOARDS` tells the extractor to include all hidden or unpublished worksheets and dashboards that are part of a Tableau workbook in the extracted metadata.\n6. `CRAWL_EMBEDDED_DASHBOARDS` tells the extractor to create relationships between Tableau dashboards used within another dashboard as a _Web Page_ item.\n7. The `CERT_PATH` tells the extractor where to store the [SSL certificate](https://docs.atlan.com/product/connections/how-tos/provide-ssl-certificates), if applicable. In this example, the extractor will store results in the `./tab-cert.pem` directory on the local file system. If the SSL certificate is not stored in the same folder as the compose file, you will need to specify the full path.\n8. The `./output/my-tableau:/output/process` line tells the extractor where to store results. In this example, the extractor will store results in the `./output/my-tableau` directory on the local file system. We recommend you output the extracted metadata for different connections in separate directories.\n9. The `secrets` section within `services` tells the extractor which secrets to use for this service. Each of these refers to the name of a secret listed at the beginning of the compose file.\n\n- [Prerequisites](https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/business-intelligence/tableau/how-tos/set-up-on-premises-tableau-access#prerequisites)\n- [Get the compose file](https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/business-intelligence/tableau/how-tos/set-up-on-premises-tableau-access#get-the-compose-file)\n- [Define Tableau connections](https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/business-intelligence/tableau/how-tos/set-up-on-premises-tableau-access#define-tableau-connections)\n- [Provide credentials](https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/business-intelligence/tableau/how-tos/set-up-on-premises-tableau-access#provide-credentials)\n- [Secure credentials](https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/business-intelligence/tableau/how-tos/set-up-on-premises-tableau-access#secure-credentials)\n- [Example](https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/business-intelligence/tableau/how-tos/set-up-on-premises-tableau-access#example)\n\n‚úï\n\nHi there, I'm Ask AI.

It is not possible to fetch data source fields and calculated fields with the _Viewer_ role in the current version of the Tableau Metadata API. Atlan uses this data to generate granular column-level lineage across data sources and SQL assets. To extract lineage for assets in Tableau, the user must have the _Site Administrator Explorer_ role.\n\n#### Is lineage available for Tableau custom SQL data sources? [‚Äã](https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/business-intelligence/tableau/troubleshooting/troubleshooting-tableau-connectivity\\#is-lineage-available-for-tableau-custom-sql-data-sources \"Direct link to Is lineage available for Tableau custom SQL data sources?\")\n\nYes, Atlan can parse custom SQL queries in Tableau to generate lineage between the data source and tables. Lineage is available for tables from all SQL sources. However, column-level lineage is currently not supported.\n\n#### Why is upstream lineage missing for Tableau data sources? [‚Äã](https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/business-intelligence/tableau/troubleshooting/troubleshooting-tableau-connectivity\\#why-is-upstream-lineage-missing-for-tableau-data-sources \"Direct link to Why is upstream lineage missing for Tableau data sources?\")\n\nIf your [Tableau data source](https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/business-intelligence/tableau/references/what-does-atlan-crawl-from-tableau) is in a [paused state](https://help.tableau.com/current/pro/desktop/en-us/refresh.htm?_gl=1*1grln1c*_ga*MTIzNzUxOTYwNS4xNzAyNjQ3NTY5*_ga_8YLN0SNXVS*MTcxMTY1MjI1Ni4xNC4xLjE3MTE2NTMyMDYuMC4wLjA.#pause-automatic-updates), the Tableau Metadata API may fail to provide the requisite metadata on source databases and tables for Atlan to generate upstream lineage. Restart your Tableau data source and ensure that it remains active while [crawling Tableau](https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/business-intelligence/tableau/how-tos/crawl-tableau). This will allow Atlan to fetch the requisite metadata to generate upstream lineage for data sources.\n\n#### Why is there a discrepancy in asset count between Tableau and Atlan?

Dashboards in Tableau are represented in collections of one or more views. These may have same names as the views but are independent objects. Hence, the total count of these views in Tableau does not match the dashboard count in Atlan. Atlan sources the dashboard count from the Tableau API, which is the only reliable way to fetch the dashboard count.\n- Data sources - embedded data sources are not reported on the Tableau UI. However, in Atlan, data sources can be filtered to show only published data sources, which should match the count of data sources on the Tableau UI.\n\n#### Can users who do not have access to a dashboard still see the preview? [‚Äã](https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/business-intelligence/tableau/troubleshooting/troubleshooting-tableau-connectivity\\#can-users-who-do-not-have-access-to-a-dashboard-still-see-the-preview \"Direct link to Can users who do not have access to a dashboard still see the preview?\")\n\nUsers can only see asset previews if the following conditions are met:\n\n- They have the necessary permissions in both Tableau and Atlan.\n- They are logged into Atlan and Tableau on the same browser.\n\nTherefore, if a user lacks the permission to view a dashboard in Tableau, they will not be able to view the dashboard preview in Atlan. Even if they do have the necessary permissions, they will need to be logged into Tableau on the same browser as their Atlan instance for asset previews to work.\n\n#### Why can I not see previews for my Tableau assets? [‚Äã](https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/business-intelligence/tableau/troubleshooting/troubleshooting-tableau-connectivity\\#why-can-i-not-see-previews-for-my-tableau-assets \"Direct link to Why can I not see previews for my Tableau assets?\")\n\n- Your Tableau assets will be updated with previews during the next run of your Tableau workflow. If you have run the workflow and still do not see the previews, we suggest you rerun the workflow. Once you've rerun the workflow, the previews should be visible to all eligible users.\n- If you're using Tableau Server with clickjack protection enabled and your Tableau instance URL is of a different origin than the Atlan instance URL, the asset previews will not load due to a same-origin error from the browser. You will need to [disable clickjack protection](https://help.tableau.com/current/server/en-us/clickjack_protection.htm) to allow the Tableau asset previews to load.\n\n#### Is the certified status in Tableau mapped to the certificates field in Atlan?

This is also only available for Tableau [projects](https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/business-intelligence/tableau/references/what-does-atlan-crawl-from-tableau#projects), [flows](https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/business-intelligence/tableau/references/what-does-atlan-crawl-from-tableau#flows), [workbooks](https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/business-intelligence/tableau/references/what-does-atlan-crawl-from-tableau), and published [data sources](https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/business-intelligence/tableau/references/what-does-atlan-crawl-from-tableau).\n\nTableau has [retired metrics methods in API 3.22](https://help.tableau.com/current/api/rest_api/en-us/REST/rest_api_ref_metrics.htm), hence source owner attribute for [metrics](https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/business-intelligence/tableau/references/what-does-atlan-crawl-from-tableau#metrics) is not supported in Atlan.\n\n#### Why am I getting a \"still creating the Metadata API store\" error?

(If you are using a private network for PostgreSQL, you will need to [set that up first](https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/database/postgresql/how-tos/set-up-a-private-network-link-to-postgresql), too.)\n\nTo crawl metadata from PostgreSQL, review the [order of operations](https://docs.atlan.com/product/connections/how-tos/order-workflows) and then complete the following steps.\n\n## Select the source [‚Äã](https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/database/postgresql/how-tos/crawl-postgresql\\#select-the-source \"Direct link to Select the source\")\n\nTo select PostgreSQL as your source:\n\n1. In the top right of any screen, navigate to **New** and then click **New Workflow**.\n2. From the list of packages, select **Postgres Assets** and click on **Setup Workflow**.\n\n## Provide credentials [‚Äã](https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/database/postgresql/how-tos/crawl-postgresql\\#provide-credentials \"Direct link to Provide credentials\")\n\nChoose your extraction method:\n\n- In **Direct** extraction, Atlan connects to your database and crawls metadata directly.\n- In **Offline** extraction, you need to first [extract metadata yourself and make it available in S3](https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/database/on-premises-databases/how-tos/set-up-on-premises-database-access).\n- In **Agent** extraction, Atlan's secure agent executes metadata extraction within the organization's environment.\n\n### Direct extraction method [‚Äã](https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/database/postgresql/how-tos/crawl-postgresql\\#direct-extraction-method \"Direct link to Direct extraction method\")\n\nTo enter your PostgreSQL credentials:\n\n1. For _Host_ enter the host for your PostgreSQL instance.\n2. For _Port_ enter the port number of your PostgreSQL instance.\n3. For _Authentication_ choose the method you configured when [setting up the PostgreSQL user](https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/database/postgresql/how-tos/set-up-postgresql):\n   - For **Basic** authentication, enter the _Username_ and _Password_ you configured in PostgreSQL.\n   - For **IAM User** authentication, enter the _AWS Access Key_, _AWS Secret Key_, and database _Username_ you configured.\n   - For **IAM Role** authentication, enter the _AWS Role ARN_ of the [new role you created](https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/database/postgresql/how-tos/set-up-postgresql) and database _Username_ you configured. (Optional) Enter the _AWS External ID_ only if you have not configured an [external ID](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_create_for-user_externalid.html) in the role definition.\n4. For _Database_ enter the name of the database to crawl.\n5. Click **Test Authentication** to confirm connectivity to PostgreSQL using these details.\n6. When successful, at the bottom of the screen click **Next**.\n\n### Offline extraction method [‚Äã](https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/database/postgresql/how-tos/crawl-postgresql\\#offline-extraction-method \"Direct link to Offline extraction method\")\n\nAtlan also supports the [offline extraction method](https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/database/on-premises-databases/how-tos/set-up-on-premises-database-access) for fetching metadata from PostgreSQL. This method uses Atlan's metadata-extractor tool to fetch metadata. You will need to first [extract the metadata](https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/database/on-premises-databases/how-tos/set-up-on-premises-database-access) yourself and then [make it available in S3](https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/database/on-premises-databases/how-tos/crawl-on-premises-databases).\n\nTo enter your S3 details:\n\n1. For _Bucket name_, enter the name of your S3 bucket or Atlan's bucket.\n2. For _Bucket prefix_, enter the S3 prefix under which all the metadata files exist. These include `database.json`, `columns-<database>.json`, and so on.\n3. When complete, at the bottom of the screen click **Next**.\n\n### Agent extraction method [‚Äã](https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/database/postgresql/how-tos/crawl-postgresql\\#agent-extraction-method \"Direct link to Agent extraction method\")\n\nAtlan supports using a Secure Agent for fetching metadata from PostgreSQL. To use a Secure Agent, follow these steps:\n\n1. Select the **Agent** tab.\n2. Configure the PostgreSQL data source by adding the secret keys for your secret store. For details on the required fields, refer to the [Direct extraction](https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/database/postgresql/how-tos/crawl-postgresql#direct-extraction-method) section.\n3. Complete the Secure Agent configuration by following the instructions in the [How to configure Secure Agent for workflow execution](https://docs.atlan.com/secure-agent/how-tos/configure-secure-agent-for-workflow-execution) guide.\n4. Click **Next** after completing the configuration.\n\n## Configure the connection [‚Äã](https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/database/postgresql/how-tos/crawl-postgresql\\#configure-the-connection \"Direct link to Configure the connection\")\n\nTo complete the PostgreSQL connection configuration:\n\n1. Provide a _Connection Name_ that represents your source environment. For example, you might use values like `production`, `development`, `gold`, or `analytics`.\n\n2. (Optional) To change the users able to manage this connection, change the users or groups listed under _Connection Admins_.\n\n\n\ndanger\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you do not specify any user or group, nobody will be able to manage the connection - not even admins.\n\n3. At the bottom of the screen, click **Next** to proceed.\n\n\n## Configure the crawler [‚Äã](https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/database/postgresql/how-tos/crawl-postgresql\\#configure-the-crawler \"Direct link to Configure the crawler\")\n\nBefore running the PostgreSQL crawler, you can further configure it. (These options are only available when using the direct extraction method.)\n\nYou can override the defaults for any of these options:\n\n- To select the assets you want to exclude from crawling, click **Exclude Metadata**. (This will default to no assets if none are specified.)\n- To select the assets you want to include in crawling, click **Include Metadata**. (This will default to all assets, if none are specified.)\n- To have the crawler ignore tables and views based on a naming convention, specify a regular expression in the _Exclude regex for tables & views_ field.\n- For _Advanced Config_, keep _Default_ for the default configuration or click **Custom** to configure the crawler:\n  - For _Enable Source Level Filtering_, click **True** to enable schema-level filtering at source or click **False** to disable it.\n  - For _Use JDBC Internal Methods_, click **True** to enable JDBC internal methods for data extraction or click **False** to disable it.\n\n**Did you know?**\n\nIf an asset appears in both the include and exclude filters, the exclude filter takes precedence.\n\n## Run the crawler [‚Äã](https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/database/postgresql/how-tos/crawl-postgresql\\#run-the-crawler \"Direct link to Run the crawler\")\n\nTo run the PostgreSQL crawler, after completing the steps above:\n\n1. To check for any [permissions or other configuration issues](https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/database/postgresql/references/preflight-checks-for-postgresql) before running the crawler, click **Preflight checks**.\n2. You can either:\n   - To run the crawler once immediately, at the bottom of the screen, click the **Run** button.\n   - To schedule the crawler to run hourly, daily, weekly, or monthly, at the bottom of the screen, click the **Schedule Run** button.\n\nOnce the crawler has completed running, you will see the assets in Atlan's asset page! üéâ\n\n- [Select the source](https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/database/postgresql/how-tos/crawl-postgresql#select-the-source)\n- [Provide credentials](https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/database/postgresql/how-tos/crawl-postgresql#provide-credentials)\n- [Configure the connection](https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/database/postgresql/how-tos/crawl-postgresql#configure-the-connection)\n- [Configure the crawler](https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/database/postgresql/how-tos/crawl-postgresql#configure-the-crawler)\n- [Run the crawler](https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/database/postgresql/how-tos/crawl-postgresql#run-the-crawler)\n\n‚úï\n\nHi there, I'm Ask AI.

[‚Äã](https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/database/postgresql/troubleshooting/troubleshooting-postgresql-connectivity\\#can-atlan-crawl-future-tables-created-by-any-user \"Direct link to Can Atlan crawl future tables created by any user?\")\n\nPostgreSQL does not provide a single command to grant access to future tables created by any user on a global level.\n\nYou will have to alter the default privileges of every current and future user that creates tables. This is to ensure that the [database role you created for integrating with Atlan](https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/database/postgresql/how-tos/set-up-postgresql) has access to the tables created by those users by default. For example:\n\n```codeBlockLines_e6Vv\nALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES FOR USER <USER_CREATING_TABLES> IN SCHEMA <SCHEMA> GRANT SELECT, REFERENCES ON TABLES TO atlan_user_role;\n\n```\n\nHowever, altering the default privileges of every current and future user may not be sustainable or controlled from a single place. To automate the granting of permissions, you can:\n\n**Grant function**\n\nYou can automate the granting of privileges to the [database role you created](https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/database/postgresql/how-tos/set-up-postgresql) for integrating with Atlan. Note that the function below is located in the public schema. You can use any schema you want to store this function:\n\n- Set custom conditions using PL/pgSQL to skip or allow only certain schemas or tables:\n\n\n\n\n\n```codeBlockLines_e6Vv\nCREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION public.grant_permissions_on_all_schemas()\nRETURNS void AS $$\nDECLARE\n      schema_name text;\nBEGIN\n      FOR schema_name IN (SELECT nspname FROM pg_namespace WHERE nspname NOT LIKE 'pg_%' AND nspname != 'information_schema')\n      LOOP\n          EXECUTE format('GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA %I TO atlan_user_role', schema_name);\n          -- grant access to all tables, including views, materialized views\n          EXECUTE format('GRANT SELECT, REFERENCES ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA %I TO atlan_user_role', schema_name);\n      END LOOP;\nEND;\n$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;\n\n```\n\n- Next, set up a periodic schedule and execute this function on a daily or hourly basis to ensure that the [database role](https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/database/postgresql/how-tos/set-up-postgresql) has access to all new schemas or tables:\n\n\n\n\n\n```codeBlockLines_e6Vv\nselect public.grant_permissions_on_all_schemas();\n\n```\n\n\n**Event triggers**\n\nYou can create an event trigger on any `CREATE SCHEMA` or `CREATE TABLE` command. This automation will ensure minimal lag, and you will not have to set up a schedule to run the above grant function.\n\nNote that the event trigger only listens to new create event triggers. You will still need to run the grant function above to ensure that the database role has access to all current schemas or tables.\n\n```codeBlockLines_e6Vv\n-- Function to grant permissions on a specific schema\nCREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION public.grant_permissions_on_schema()\nRETURNS event_trigger AS $$\nDECLARE\n    obj record;\nBEGIN\n    FOR obj IN SELECT * FROM pg_event_trigger_ddl_commands() WHERE command_tag = 'CREATE SCHEMA'\n    LOOP\n        EXECUTE format('GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA %I TO atlan_user_role', obj.object_identity);\n        RAISE NOTICE 'Granted USAGE on schema % to atlan_user_role', obj.object_identity;\n    END LOOP;\nEND;\n$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;\n\n-- Event trigger for new schemas\nCREATE EVENT TRIGGER grant_permissions_on_new_schema ON ddl_command_end\nWHEN TAG IN ('CREATE SCHEMA')\nEXECUTE FUNCTION public.grant_permissions_on_schema();\n\n-- Function to grant permissions on a specific table\nCREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION public.grant_permissions_on_table()\nRETURNS event_trigger AS $$\nDECLARE\n    obj record;\nBEGIN\n    FOR obj IN SELECT * FROM pg_event_trigger_ddl_commands() WHERE command_tag = 'CREATE TABLE'\n                                                                or command_tag = 'CREATE VIEW'\n                                                                or command_tag = 'CREATE TABLE AS'\n                                                                or command_tag = 'CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW'\n    LOOP\n        EXECUTE format('GRANT SELECT, REFERENCES ON TABLE %s TO atlan_user_role', obj.object_identity);\n        RAISE NOTICE 'Granted SELECT, REFERENCES on table % to atlan_user_role', obj.object_identity;\n    END LOOP;\nEND;\n$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;\n\n-- Event trigger for new tables, views, mat views\nCREATE EVENT TRIGGER grant_permissions_on_new_table ON ddl_command_end\nWHEN TAG IN ('CREATE TABLE', 'CREATE VIEW', 'CREATE TABLE AS', 'CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW')\nEXECUTE FUNCTION public.grant_permissions_on_table();\n\n```\n\n‚úï\n\nHi there, I'm Ask AI.

By default, users cannot access any objects in schemas that they do not own. The owner of a schema must grant the `USAGE` privilege on the schema to allow access.\n  - Fetch the technical metadata persisted in the `INFORMATION_SCHEMA`.\n\nThese permissions enables Atlan to crawl metadat from PostgreSQL.\n\n## (Optional) Grant permissions to query and preview data [‚Äã](https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/database/postgresql/how-tos/set-up-postgresql\\#optional-grant-permissions-to-query-and-preview-data \"Direct link to (Optional) Grant permissions to query and preview data\")\n\nTo grant permissions to query data and preview sample data:\n\n```codeBlockLines_e6Vv\n GRANT SELECT, REFERENCES ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA schema_name TO atlan_user_role;\n\n```\n\n- Replace `schema_name`: Name of the schema you want Atlan to access.\n- Replace `atlan_user_role`: Role assigned to Atlan in your database.\n\nThe `SELECT` privilege is required to preview and query data from within Atlan.\n\n## Choose authentication mechanism [‚Äã](https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/database/postgresql/how-tos/set-up-postgresql\\#choose-authentication-mechanism \"Direct link to Choose authentication mechanism\")\n\nAtlan currently supports the following authentication mechanisms. You will need to choose one and configure it according to the steps below.\n\n- [Basic authentication](https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/database/postgresql/how-tos/set-up-postgresql#basic-authentication)\n- [Identity and Access Management (IAM) authentication](https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/database/postgresql/how-tos/set-up-postgresql#identity-and-access-management-iam-authentication)\n\n## Basic authentication [‚Äã](https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/database/postgresql/how-tos/set-up-postgresql\\#basic-authentication \"Direct link to Basic authentication\")\n\nTo create a username and password for basic authentication for PostgreSQL run the following commands:\n\n```codeBlockLines_e6Vv\nCREATE USER atlan_user password '<pass>';\nGRANT atlan_user_role TO atlan_user;\n\n```\n\n- Replace `<pass>` with the password for the `atlan_user` user you are creating.\n\n## Identity and Access Management (IAM) authentication [‚Äã](https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/database/postgresql/how-tos/set-up-postgresql\\#identity-and-access-management-iam-authentication \"Direct link to Identity and Access Management (IAM) authentication\")\n\nTo configure IAM authentication for PostgreSQL follow each of these steps.\n\n### Enable IAM authentication [‚Äã](https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/database/postgresql/how-tos/set-up-postgresql\\#enable-iam-authentication \"Direct link to Enable IAM authentication\")\n\nTo enable IAM authentication for your database instance follow [the steps in the Amazon RDS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.IAMDBAuth.Enabling.html).\n\nWhen given the option, apply the changes immediately and wait until they are complete.\n\n### Create database user [‚Äã](https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/database/postgresql/how-tos/set-up-postgresql\\#create-database-user \"Direct link to Create database user\")\n\nTo create a database user with the necessary permissions run the following commands:\n\n1.

To create an AWS IAM role:\n1. Follow [the steps in the AWS Identity and Access Management User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_create_for-user.html).\n\n2. When prompted for policies, attach the policy created in the previous step to this role.\n\n3. [Raise a support ticket](https://docs.atlan.com/support/submit-request) to provide the AWS IAM role ARN to Atlan and get the ARN of the _Node Instance Role_ for your Atlan EKS cluster from Atlan.\n\n4. When prompted, create a trust relationship for the role using the following trust policy. (Replace `<atlan_nodeinstance_role_arn>` with the ARN received from Atlan support.)\n\n\n\n\n\n     ```codeBlockLines_e6Vv\n     {\n       \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\",\n       \"Statement\": [\\\n         {\\\n           \"Effect\": \"Allow\",\\\n           \"Principal\": {\"AWS\": \"<atlan_nodeinstance_role_arn>\"},\\\n           \"Action\": \"sts:AssumeRole\",\\\n         }\\\n       ]\n     }\n\n     ```\n- **IAM user**: Create an AWS IAM user and attach the policy to this user. To create an AWS IAM user:\n1. Follow [the steps in the AWS Identity and Access Management User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_users_create.html).\n\n2. On the _Set permissions_ page, attach the policy created in the previous step to this user.\n\n3. Once the user is created, view or download the user's¬†_access key ID_ and¬†_secret access key_.\n\n\n\n     danger\n\n\n\n\n\n     This will be your only opportunity to view or download the access keys.

(If you are also using a private network for MySQL, you will need to [set that up first](https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/database/mysql/how-tos/set-up-a-private-network-link-to-mysql), too.)\n\nCrawl MySQL\n\nA\n\nCrawl MySQL\n\n![Begin by adding a new workflow](https://cdn.arcade.software/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,dpr=2,width=3840/extension-uploads/e659a3a1-2902-4fcf-9baa-ebc1c8f21dfe.png)![The MySQL Assets package allows us to crawl metadata from MySQL](https://cdn.arcade.software/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,dpr=2,width=3840/extension-uploads/bad63661-0732-4f0d-b5c6-d5a71efb71f9.png)\n\nInteractive walkthrough\n\nreCAPTCHA\n\nRecaptcha requires verification.\n\n[Privacy](https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/) \\- [Terms](https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/terms/)\n\nprotected by **reCAPTCHA**\n\n[Privacy](https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/) \\- [Terms](https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/terms/)\n\nTo crawl metadata from MySQL, review the [order of operations](https://docs.atlan.com/product/connections/how-tos/order-workflows) and then complete the following steps.\n\n## Select the source [‚Äã](https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/database/mysql/how-tos/crawl-mysql\\#select-the-source \"Direct link to Select the source\")\n\nTo select MySQL as your source:\n\n1. In the top right of any screen, navigate to **New** and then click **New Workflow**.\n2. From the list of packages, select **MySQL Assets** and click on **Setup Workflow**.\n\n## Provide credentials [‚Äã](https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/database/mysql/how-tos/crawl-mysql\\#provide-credentials \"Direct link to Provide credentials\")\n\nChoose your extraction method:\n\n- In **Direct** extraction, Atlan connects to your database and crawls metadata directly.\n- In **Offline** extraction, you need to first [extract metadata yourself and make it available in S3](https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/database/on-premises-databases/how-tos/set-up-on-premises-database-access).\n- In **Agent** extraction, Atlan's secure agent executes metadata extraction within the organization's environment.\n\n### Direct extraction method [‚Äã](https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/database/mysql/how-tos/crawl-mysql\\#direct-extraction-method \"Direct link to Direct extraction method\")\n\nTo enter your MySQL credentials:\n\n1. For _Host Name_ enter the host for your MySQL instance.\n\n2. For _Port_ enter the port number of your MySQL instance.\n\n3. For _Authentication_ choose the method you configured when [setting up the MySQL user](https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/database/mysql/how-tos/set-up-mysql):\n   - For **Basic** authentication, enter the _Username_ and _Password_ you configured in MySQL.\n   - For **IAM User** authentication, enter the _AWS Access Key_, _AWS Secret Key_, and database _Username_ you configured.\n   - For **IAM Role** authentication, enter the _AWS Role ARN_ of the [new role you created](https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/database/mysql/how-tos/set-up-mysql) and database _Username_ you configured. (Optional) Enter the _AWS External ID_ only if you have not configured an [external ID](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_create_for-user_externalid.html) in the role definition.\n4. Click **Test Authentication** to confirm connectivity to MySQL using these details.\n\n\n\ninfo\n\n\n\n\n\nüí™ **Did you know?** If you get an `Error: 1129: Host ... is blocked because of many connection errors; unblock with 'mysqladmin flush-hosts'`, ask your database admin to run the `FLUSH HOSTS;` command in the RDS instance, and then try again.\n\n5. When successful, at the bottom of the screen click **Next**.\n\n\n### Offline extraction method [‚Äã](https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/database/mysql/how-tos/crawl-mysql\\#offline-extraction-method \"Direct link to Offline extraction method\")\n\nAtlan also supports the [offline extraction method](https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/database/on-premises-databases/how-tos/set-up-on-premises-database-access) for fetching metadata from MySQL. This method uses Atlan's metadata-extractor tool to fetch metadata. You will need to first [extract the metadata](https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/database/on-premises-databases/how-tos/set-up-on-premises-database-access) yourself and then [make it available in S3](https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/database/on-premises-databases/how-tos/crawl-on-premises-databases).\n\nTo enter your S3 details:\n\n1. For _Bucket name_, enter the name of your S3 bucket or Atlan's bucket.\n2. For _Bucket prefix_, enter the S3 prefix under which all the metadata files exist. These include `databases.json`, `columns-<database>.json`, and so on.\n3. (Optional) For _Bucket region_, enter the name of the S3 region.\n4. When complete, at the bottom of the screen click **Next**.\n\n### Agent extraction method [‚Äã](https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/database/mysql/how-tos/crawl-mysql\\#agent-extraction-method \"Direct link to Agent extraction method\")\n\nAtlan supports using a Secure Agent for fetching metadata from MySQL. To use a Secure Agent, follow these steps:\n\n1. Select the **Agent** tab.\n2. Configure the MySQL data source by adding the secret keys for your secret store. For details on the required fields, refer to the [Direct extraction](https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/database/mysql/how-tos/crawl-mysql#direct-extraction-method) section.\n3. Complete the Secure Agent configuration by following the instructions in the [How to configure Secure Agent for workflow execution](https://docs.atlan.com/secure-agent/how-tos/configure-secure-agent-for-workflow-execution) guide.\n4. Click **Next** after completing the configuration.\n\n## Configure the connection [‚Äã](https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/database/mysql/how-tos/crawl-mysql\\#configure-the-connection \"Direct link to Configure the connection\")\n\nTo complete the MySQL connection configuration:\n\n1. Provide a _Connection Name_ that represents your source environment. For example, you might use values like `production`, `development`, `gold`, or `analytics`.\n\n2. (Optional) To change the users able to manage this connection, change the users or groups listed under _Connection Admins_.\n\n\n\ndanger\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you do not specify any user or group, nobody will be able to manage the connection - not even admins.\n\n3. (Optional) To prevent users from querying any MySQL data, change _Allow SQL Query_ to **No**.\n\n4. (Optional) To prevent users from previewing any MySQL data, change _Allow Data Preview_ to **No**.\n\n5. At the bottom of the screen, click **Next** to proceed.\n\n\n## Configure the crawler [‚Äã](https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/database/mysql/how-tos/crawl-mysql\\#configure-the-crawler \"Direct link to Configure the crawler\")\n\nBefore running the MySQL crawler, you can further configure it. (Some of the options may only be available when using the [direct extraction method](https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/database/mysql/how-tos/crawl-mysql#direct-extraction-method).)\n\nYou can override the defaults for any of these options:\n\n- To select the assets you want to include in crawling, click **Include Metadata**. (This will default to all assets, if none are specified.)\n- To select the assets you want to exclude from crawling, click **Exclude Metadata**. (This will default to no assets if none are specified.)\n- To have the crawler ignore tables and views based on a naming convention, specify a regular expression in the _Exclude regex for tables & views_ field.\n- For _Advanced Config_, keep _Default_ for the default configuration or click **Custom** to configure the crawler:\n  - For _Enable Source Level Filtering_, click **True** to enable schema-level filtering at source or click **False** to disable it.\n  - For _Use JDBC Internal Methods_, click **True** to enable JDBC internal methods for data extraction or click **False** to disable it.\n\n**Did you know?**\n\nIf an asset appears in both the include and exclude filters, the exclude filter takes precedence.\n\n## Run the crawler [‚Äã](https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/database/mysql/how-tos/crawl-mysql\\#run-the-crawler \"Direct link to Run the crawler\")\n\nTo run the MySQL crawler, after completing the steps above:\n\n1. To check for any [permissions or other configuration issues](https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/database/mysql/references/preflight-checks-for-mysql) before running the crawler, click **Preflight checks**.\n2. You can either:\n   - To run the crawler once immediately, at the bottom of the screen, click the **Run** button.\n   - To schedule the crawler to run hourly, daily, weekly, or monthly, at the bottom of the screen, click the **Schedule Run** button.\n\nOnce the crawler has completed running, you will see the assets in Atlan's asset page! üéâ\n\n- [Select the source](https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/database/mysql/how-tos/crawl-mysql#select-the-source)\n- [Provide credentials](https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/database/mysql/how-tos/crawl-mysql#provide-credentials)\n- [Configure the connection](https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/database/mysql/how-tos/crawl-mysql#configure-the-connection)\n- [Configure the crawler](https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/database/mysql/how-tos/crawl-mysql#configure-the-crawler)\n- [Run the crawler](https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/database/mysql/how-tos/crawl-mysql#run-the-crawler)",

It makes applications more scalable, secure, and resilient to database failures. Amazon RDS Proxy sits between your application and relational database to efficiently manage connections to the database and improve scalability of the application.\n\nWhen setting up a [private network link to MySQL](https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/database/mysql/how-tos/set-up-a-private-network-link-to-mysql), Amazon RDS Proxy can help with:\n\n- Connection pooling - RDS Proxy helps manage database connections by pooling them and reusing them across multiple application connections. This reduces the overhead of establishing new connections for each database request and improves performance.\n- Scalability - it automatically scales connection capacity based on demand, allowing applications to handle a high number of concurrent database connections without overwhelming the database instance. It also helps distribute the workload across multiple database instances, enabling horizontal scalability.\n- Connection multiplexing - RDS Proxy multiplexes multiple database connections over a single secure connection. This reduces the number of connections to the database, conserving system resources and reducing the chance of hitting connection limits.\n- Security - it integrates with [AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)](https://aws.amazon.com/iam/), allowing fine-grained control over who can access the proxy and underlying database. It also supports Amazon virtual private cloud (VPC) endpoints, enhancing security through private connectivity.\n\nFor more questions, head over to [Amazon RDS Proxy FAQs](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/proxy/faqs/).\n\n‚úï\n\nHi there, I'm Ask AI.

You will need to choose one and configure it according to the steps below.\n\n- [Basic authentication](https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/database/mysql/how-tos/set-up-mysql#basic-authentication)\n- [Identity and Access Management (IAM) authentication](https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/database/mysql/how-tos/set-up-mysql#identity-and-access-management-iam-authentication)\n\n## Basic authentication [‚Äã](https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/database/mysql/how-tos/set-up-mysql\\#basic-authentication \"Direct link to Basic authentication\")\n\nTo configure basic authentication for MySQL, run the following commands:\n\n```codeBlockLines_e6Vv\nCREATE USER '{{db-username}}'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY '{{password}}';\nGRANT SELECT,SHOW VIEW,EXECUTE ON *.* TO '{{db-username}}'@'%';\nFLUSH PRIVILEGES;\n\n```\n\n- Replace `{{db-username}}` with the username you want to create.\n- Replace `{{password}}` with the password to be used for that username.\n\nAtlan requires the following privileges to:\n\n- `SELECT`:\n  - Fetch the technical metadata persisted in the `INFORMATION_SCHEMA`. `*.*` is required because `INFORMATION_SCHEMA` tables cannot be granted access directly. Metadata is inferred from the access that the querying user has on the underlying tables.\n  - Enable users to preview or query the underlying tables and views - this functionality can also be turned off.\n- `SHOW VIEW` enables the use of the `SHOW CREATE VIEW` statement to fetch view definitions for generating lineage.\n- `EXECUTE` is only required if using MySQL 5.7 and any earlier versions.\n\n## Identity and Access Management (IAM) authentication [‚Äã](https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/database/mysql/how-tos/set-up-mysql\\#identity-and-access-management-iam-authentication \"Direct link to Identity and Access Management (IAM) authentication\")\n\nTo configure IAM authentication for MySQL follow each of these steps.\n\n### Enable IAM authentication [‚Äã](https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/database/mysql/how-tos/set-up-mysql\\#enable-iam-authentication \"Direct link to Enable IAM authentication\")\n\nTo enable IAM authentication for your database instance:\n\n- For Amazon RDS, follow [the steps in the Amazon RDS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.IAMDBAuth.Enabling.html).\n- For Aurora, follow [the steps in the User Guide for Aurora documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/UsingWithRDS.IAMDBAuth.Enabling.html).\n\nWhen given the option, apply the changes immediately and wait until they are complete.\n\n### Create database user [‚Äã](https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/database/mysql/how-tos/set-up-mysql\\#create-database-user \"Direct link to Create database user\")\n\nTo create a database user with the necessary permissions run the following commands:\n\n```codeBlockLines_e6Vv\nCREATE USER '{{db-username}}'@'%' IDENTIFIED WITH AWSAuthenticationPlugin as 'RDS';\nGRANT SELECT,SHOW VIEW,EXECUTE ON *.* TO '{{db-username}}'@'%';\nFLUSH PRIVILEGES;\n\n```\n\n- Replace `{{db-username}}` with the username you want to create.\n\nThese permissions will allow you to crawl metadata, preview and query data from within Atlan.\n\n### Create IAM policy [‚Äã](https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/database/mysql/how-tos/set-up-mysql\\#create-iam-policy \"Direct link to Create IAM policy\")\n\nTo create an IAM policy with the necessary permissions follow [the steps in the AWS Identity and Access Management User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_create.html).\n\nCreate the policy using the following JSON:\n\n```codeBlockLines_e6Vv\n{\n  \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\",\n  \"Statement\": [\\\n    {\\\n      \"Effect\": \"Allow\",\\\n      \"Action\": [\\\n        \"rds-db:connect\"\\\n      ],\\\n      \"Resource\": [\\\n        \"arn:aws:rds-db:{{aws-region}}:{{account-id}}:dbuser:{{resource-id}}/{{db-username}}\"\\\n      ]\\\n    }\\\n  ]\n}\n\n```\n\n- Replace `{{aws-region}}` with the AWS region of your database instance.\n- Replace `{{account-id}}` with your account ID.\n- Replace `{{resource-id}}` with the resource ID.\n- Replace `{{db-username}}` with the username created in the previous step.\n\n### Attach IAM policy [‚Äã](https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/database/mysql/how-tos/set-up-mysql\\#attach-iam-policy \"Direct link to Attach IAM policy\")\n\nTo attach the IAM policy for Atlan's use, you have two options:\n\n- **IAM role**: Attach the policy created in the previous step to the EC2 role that Atlan uses for its EC2 instances in the EKS cluster. Please [raise a support ticket](https://docs.atlan.com/support/submit-request) to use this option.\n- **IAM user**: Create an AWS IAM user and attach the policy to this user. To create an AWS IAM user:\n1. Follow [the steps in the AWS Identity and Access Management User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_users_create.html).\n\n2.

For example:\n\n\n\n\n\n```codeBlockLines_e6Vv\nlet\nSource = Snowflake.Databases(\"example.snowflakecomputing.com\",\"EXAMPLE_WAREHOUSE\",[Role=\"EXAMPLE_ROLE\"]),\nEXAMPLE_DB = Source{[Name=\"EXAMPLE_DATABASE_NAME\",Kind=\"Database\"]}[Data],\nEXAMPLE_Sch = EXAMPLE_DB{[Name=\"EXAMPLE_SCHEMA_NAME\",Kind=\"Schema\"]}[Data],\nEXAMPLE_Table_Var = EXAMPLE_Sch{[Name=\"EXAMPLE_TABLE_NAME\",Kind=\"Table\"]}[Data]\nin\nEXAMPLE_Table_Var\n\n```\n\n- Atlan retrieves the Power Query expression as a plain string from the [Microsoft Power BI API](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/power-bi/admin/workspace-info-get-scan-result) response.\n\n- Atlan's custom query parser then parses the Power Query expression to derive lineage between the upstream SQL tables and Microsoft Power BI table asset.\n\n\nHowever, note that the Power Query expression can be modified in the Power Query Editor of the Power BI Desktop application. These modifications may involve using parameter substitutes and variable naming patterns in the Power Query expression.\n\nThese modifications may lead to inconsistent behavior in Atlan's query parser. This is because the latter is built on the standard format of a Power Query expression, without any modifications.\n\n## Limitations of query parser [‚Äã](https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/business-intelligence/microsoft-power-bi/references/what-lineage-does-atlan-extract-from-microsoft-power-bi\\#limitations-of-query-parser \"Direct link to Limitations of query parser\")\n\nTo ensure seamless lineage generation, Atlan recommends the following when building tables in Microsoft Power BI.\n\n### ODBC-based data sources [‚Äã](https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/business-intelligence/microsoft-power-bi/references/what-lineage-does-atlan-extract-from-microsoft-power-bi\\#odbc-based-data-sources \"Direct link to ODBC-based data sources\")\n\nUpstream lineage is not supported for ODBC-based data sources.\n\n### Using parameters [‚Äã](https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/business-intelligence/microsoft-power-bi/references/what-lineage-does-atlan-extract-from-microsoft-power-bi\\#using-parameters \"Direct link to Using parameters\")\n\nThe Power Query expression associated with a table can be manually modified to serve different use cases. For example, if you're creating multiple tables using data from the same database and schema at source, you may want to use [dynamic M query parameters](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/connect-data/desktop-dynamic-m-query-parameters) to substitute common values in Power Query expressions.\n\nAtlan recommends the following:\n\n- Avoid using the following words to define your parameter names:\n  - `Database`\n  - `Schema`\n  - `Table`\n  - `View`\n  - `Warehouse`\n  - `Role`\n- Avoid including any spaces in your parameter names - for example, `( Example : Example DB )`\n\nFor example, Atlan's query parser does not support the following:\n\n```codeBlockLines_e6Vv\nlet\nSource = Snowflake.Databases(\"example.snowflakecomputing.com\",WarehouseName,[Role=\"EXAMPLE_ROLE\"]),\nDatabaseName = Source{[Name=DatabaseName,Kind=\"Database\"]}[Data],\nEXAMPLE_Sch = DatabaseName{[Name=SchemaName,Kind=\"Schema\"]}[Data],\nEXAMPLE_Table_Var = EXAMPLE_Sch{[Name=TableName,Kind=\"Table\"]}[Data]\nin\nEXAMPLE_Table_Var\n\n```\n\n- The above example includes `WarehouseName`, `DatabaseName`, `SchemaName`, and `TableName` as parameters, which are not supported in the query parser.\n\n### Parameter syntax [‚Äã](https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/business-intelligence/microsoft-power-bi/references/what-lineage-does-atlan-extract-from-microsoft-power-bi\\#parameter-syntax \"Direct link to Parameter syntax\")\n\nThere are different formats for the syntax used in parameter names for Power Query expressions. For example, `param_name`, `#‚Äùparam_name‚Äù`, or `#\"param name‚Äù`.\n\nAtlan recommends the following for parameter names:\n\n- Use plain text format\n- Avoid any special characters - for example, `#`, `\"`, and more\n\nFor example, Atlan's query parser does not support the following:\n\n```codeBlockLines_e6Vv\nlet\nSource = Snowflake.Databases(\"example.snowflakecomputing.com\",\"EXAMPLE_WAREHOUSE\",[Role=\"EXAMPLE_ROLE\"]),\nDatabaseName = Source{[Name=#\"DatabaseName\",Kind=\"Database\"]}[Data],\nEXAMPLE_Sch = DatabaseName{[Name=\"EXAMPLE_SCHEMA_NAME\",Kind=\"Schema\"]}[Data],\nEXAMPLE_Table_Var = EXAMPLE_Sch{[Name=\"EXAMPLE_TABLE_NAME\",Kind=\"Table\"]}[Data]\nin\nEXAMPLE_Table_Var\n\n```\n\n- The above example includes `#\"DatabaseName\"` as parameter name, which is not supported in the query parser.\n\n### Variable names [‚Äã](https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/business-intelligence/microsoft-power-bi/references/what-lineage-does-atlan-extract-from-microsoft-power-bi\\#variable-names \"Direct link to Variable names\")\n\nWhile using parameters in Power Query expressions, ensure that the variable names do not match the parameter names. For example, Atlan's query parser does not support the following:\n\n```codeBlockLines_e6Vv\nlet\nSource = Snowflake.Databases(\"example.snowflakecomputing.com\",\"EXAMPLE_WAREHOUSE\",[Role=\"EXAMPLE_ROLE\"]),\nDatabaseName = Source{[Name=DatabaseName,Kind=\"Database\"]}[Data],\nEXAMPLE_Sch = DatabaseName{[Name=\"EXAMPLE_SCHEMA_NAME\",Kind=\"Schema\"]}[Data],\nEXAMPLE_Table_Var = EXAMPLE_Sch{[Name=\"EXAMPLE_TABLE_NAME\",Kind=\"Table\"]}[Data]\nin\nEXAMPLE_Table_Var\n\n```\n\n- In the above example, `DatabaseName` is used as both a parameter name and variable name, which is not supported in the query parser.\n\n### User-defined expressions [‚Äã](https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/business-intelligence/microsoft-power-bi/references/what-lineage-does-atlan-extract-from-microsoft-power-bi\\#user-defined-expressions \"Direct link to User-defined expressions\")\n\nParts of a Power Query expression can be parameterized and cross-referenced in other Power Query expressions. Atlan's query parser currently only parses standard forms of Power Query expressions, hence these user-defined expressions are not supported.\n\nExample of a supported Power Query expression:\n\n```codeBlockLines_e6Vv\nlet\nSource = Snowflake.Databases(\"example.snowflakecomputing.com\",\"EXAMPLE_WAREHOUSE\",[Role=\"EXAMPLE_ROLE\"]),\nEXAMPLE_DB = Source{[Name=\"EXAMPLE_DATABASE_NAME\",Kind=\"Database\"]}[Data],\nEXAMPLE_Sch = EXAMPLE_DB{[Name=\"EXAMPLE_SCHEMA_NAME\",Kind=\"Schema\"]}[Data],\nEXAMPLE_Table_Var = EXAMPLE_Sch{[Name=\"TBL_AGG_SALES_HT_POS_BEER\",Kind=\"Table\"]}[Data]\nin\nEXAMPLE_Table_Var\n\n```\n\nExample of an unsupported Power Query expression:\n\n```codeBlockLines_e6Vv\nlet\nSource = db_source,\nEXAMPLE_Sch = db_source{[Name=\"EXAMPLE_SCHEMA_NAME\",Kind=\"Schema\"]}[Data],\nEXAMPLE_Table_Var = EXAMPLE_Sch{[Name=\"EXAMPLE_TABLE_NAME\",Kind=\"Table\"]}[Data]\nin\nEXAMPLE_Table_Var\n\n```\n\nExample of a reference expression, parameterized as `db_source`:\n\n```codeBlockLines_e6Vv\nlet\nSource = Snowflake.Databases(\"example.snowflakecomputing.com\",\"EXAMPLE_WAREHOUSE\",[Role=\"EXAMPLE_ROLE\"]),\nEXAMPLE_DB = Source{[Name=\"EXAMPLE_DATABASE_NAME\",Kind=\"Database\"]}[Data]\nin\nEXAMPLE_DB\n\n```\n\n### Table functions [‚Äã](https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/business-intelligence/microsoft-power-bi/references/what-lineage-does-atlan-extract-from-microsoft-power-bi\\#table-functions \"Direct link to Table functions\")\n\nAtlan's custom query parser currently does not support parsing expressions with [table functions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powerquery-m/table-functions).\n\n### Power Query functions [‚Äã](https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/business-intelligence/microsoft-power-bi/references/what-lineage-does-atlan-extract-from-microsoft-power-bi\\#power-query-functions \"Direct link to Power Query functions\")\n\nUpstream lineage is not supported when the data source expression involves the use of certain built-in Power Query functions.
