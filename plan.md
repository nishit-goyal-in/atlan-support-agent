 # Atlan Support Agent v2 - Development Plan

## Overview

This document outlines a comprehensive 7-phase development plan for building a production-ready FastAPI backend that answers Atlan documentation questions using RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), intelligently routes conversations, and includes continuous evaluation capabilities.

### Project Objectives
- Automate initial support for Atlan users by answering documentation questions
- Maintain low latency (p50 < 2s) with parallel processing architecture
- Implement intelligent conversation routing with escalation capabilities
- Provide continuous auto-evaluation with LLM-as-judge
- Build minimal HTML test UI for validation and monitoring

### Success Criteria
- Response time: p50 < 2s 
- Clear routing decisions with explicit reasoning and triggers
- Multi-turn conversation with full history retention
- Async evaluation runs in background and is visible in UI
- All test scenarios pass (documentation queries, multi-turn discussions, frustration detection, knowledge gaps, billing/account questions)

### Architecture Approach
- **Hybrid Architecture**: LangChain agent for search decisions + traditional prompt templates for generation/routing
- **Parallel Processing**: Run response generation and routing classification simultaneously after retrieval
- **Vector Store**: Pinecone with OpenAI embeddings for semantic search
- **LLM Provider**: OpenRouter with configurable models
- **Evaluation**: Background LLM-as-judge with structured scoring rubric
